Divergence genetics analysis reveals historical population genetic processes leading to contrasting phylogeographic patterns in co-distributed species								MOLECULAR ECOLOGY				19	22			5043	5060		10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04854.x			NOV 2010	2010	Coalescent samplers are computational time machines for inferring the historical demographic genetic processes that have given rise to observable patterns of spatial genetic variation among contemporary populations. We have used traditional characterizations of population structure and coalescent-based inferences about demographic processes to reconstruct the population histories of two co-distributed marine species, the frilled dog whelk, Nucella lamellosa, and the bat star, Patiria miniata. Analyses of population structure were consistent with previous work in both species except that additional samples of N. lamellosa showed a larger regional genetic break on Vancouver Island (VI) rather than between the southern Alexander Archipelago as in P. miniata. Our understanding of the causes, rather than just the patterns, of spatial genetic variation was dramatically improved by coalescent analyses that emphasized variation in population divergence times. Overall, gene flow was greater in bat stars (planktonic development) than snails (benthic development) but spatially homogeneous within species. In both species, these large phylogeographic breaks corresponded to relatively ancient divergence times between populations rather than regionally restricted gene flow. Although only N. lamellosa shows a large break on VI, population separation times on VI are congruent between species, suggesting a similar response to late Pleistocene ice sheet expansion. The absence of a phylogeographic break in P. miniata on VI can be attributed to greater gene flow and larger effective population size in this species. Such insights put the relative significance of gene flow into a more comprehensive historical biogeographic context and have important implications for conservation and landscape genetic studies that emphasize the role of contemporary gene flow and connectivity in shaping patterns of population differentiation.									29	0	0	30	1	30			0962-1083	1365-294X		WOS:000283986700018	21040048

An Enhanced-Physics-Based Scheme for the NS-alpha Turbulence Model								NUMERICAL METHODS FOR PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS				26	6			1530	1555		10.1002/num.20509			NOV 2010	2010	We study a new enhanced-physics-based numerical scheme for the NS-alpha turbulence model that conserves both energy and helicity. Although most turbulence models (in the continuous case) conserve only energy, NS-alpha is one of only a very few that also conserve helicity. This is one reason why it is becoming accepted as the most physically accurate turbulence model. However, no numerical scheme for NS-alpha, until now, conserved both energy and helicity, and thus the advantage gained in physical accuracy by modeling with NS-alpha could be lost in a computation. This report presents a finite element numerical scheme, and gives a rigorous analysis of its conservation properties, stability, solution existence, and convergence. A key feature of the analysis is the identification of the discrete energy and energy dissipation norms, and proofs that these norms are equivalent (provided a careful choice of filtering radius) in the discrete space to the usual energy and energy dissipation norms. Numerical experiments are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme over usual (helicity-ignoring) schemes. A generalization of this scheme to a family of high-order NS-alpha-deconvolution models, which combine the attractive physical properties of NS-alpha with the high accuracy gained by combining a-filtering with van Cittert approximate deconvolution.

J	God, Jason; Tate, Patricia L.; Larcom, Lyndon L.								Red raspberries have antioxidant effects that play a minor role in the killing of stomach and colon cancer cells								NUTRITION RESEARCH				30	11			777	782		10.1016/j.nutres.2010.10.004			NOV 2010	2010	Berries and berry extracts possess properties that make them important in the prevention of cancer. The high antioxidant levels of these extracts play a role, but components of the berries can have other effects on cell replication and survival. We chose to test the hypothesis that (i) although the antioxidant capacity of raspberry extracts is important for inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells, other characteristics of the berry extracts are responsible for a major part of their antiproliferative activity, and that (ii) the relative importance of the antioxidant effect can depend on the cell type being studied. The aim of this study was to assess the relative roles of low pH and high antioxidant levels in the killing of 3 cell types by an aqueous extract from Meeker red raspberries. Stomach, colon, and breast cancer cells were treated with berry extract and with HCl and ascorbic acid solutions of the same pH. A dilution of 7.5% ascorbic acid solution, of the same pH and slightly higher antioxidant concentration than the berry extract, killed less than 10% of the stomach and colon cancer cells. In contrast, the berry extract at this same dilution killed more than 90% of these cells. Antioxidants played a more significant role in the killing of breast cancer cells, however. For these cells, approximately 50% of the killing could be attributed to antioxidant effects. We conclude that the antioxidant effect plays a minor role in the killing of 2 gastrointestinal cell types, but its role in inactivating a breast cancer cell line is much more significant. No evidence of apoptosis was observed, and caspase activation did not contribute to cell killing by the extract. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We report the identification of a mutant in nodule regulation in Medicago truncatula, like sunn supernodulator (lss), which displays shoot-controlled supernodulation and short roots, similar to sunn mutants. In contrast with the sunn-1 mutant, nodulation in the lss mutant is more extensive and is less sensitive to nitrate and ethylene, resembling the sunn-4 presumed null allele phenotype. Although the lss locus maps to the SUNN region of linkage group 4 and sunn and lss do not complement each other, there is no mutation in the genomic copy of the SUNN gene or in the 15-kb surrounding region in the lss mutant. However, expression of the SUNN gene in the shoots of lss plants is greatly reduced compared with wild-type plants. Analysis of cDNA from plants heterozygous for lss indicates that lss is a cis-acting factor affecting the expression of SUNN, and documented reversion events show it to be unstable, suggesting a possible reversible DNA rearrangement or an epigenetic change in the lss mutant. Assessment of the SUNN promoter revealed low levels of cytosine methylation in the 700-bp region proximal to the predicted transcription start site in both wild-type and lss plants, indicating that promoter hypermethylation is not responsible for the suppression of SUNN expression in lss. Thus, lss represents either a distal novel locus within the mapped region affecting SUNN expression or an uncharacterized epigenetic modification at the SUNN locus.									18	0	0	18	0	19			0032-0889			WOS:000283710300032	20861425

A continuum approach may fail to explain some of the phenomena associated with liquefaction. Discrete approach, such as distinct/discrete element method (DEM), is an effective method that can simulate the mechanism of liquefaction and associated phenomena well at the microscopic level.In this study, a new three-dimensional DEM model is developed to study the liquefaction and as associated phenomena. The hollow cylindrical torsion test under undrained condition, which replicates the ground condition before and during the earthquake well, is simulated using the newly developed model. A vertical strip from the hollow cylindrical specimen is considered in the study and the boundaries in the tangential direction are numerically connected to simulate the continuity in tangential direction The liquefaction study is carried out by strain control shearing at the top while keeping the bottom plate fixed The cyclic mobility, which is observed in saturated sands when subjected to cyclic shearing, is predicted by the proposed model The effect of particle rotation on the development of dynamic pore water pressure is also investigated using the model. Also, sand boiling is simulated using the proposed model (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved									2	0	0	0	0	2			0267-7261			WOS:000281624200008

The dominant resistance locus Pl (ARG) originates from silverleaf sunflower (H. argophyllus Torrey and Gray) and confers resistance to all known races of P. halstedii. We mapped Pl (ARG) on linkage group (LG) 1 of (cms)HA342 x ARG1575-2, a population consisting of 2,145 F-2 individuals. Further, we identified resistance gene candidates (RGCs) that cosegregated with Pl (ARG) as well as closely linked flanking markers. Markers from the target region were mapped with higher resolution in NDBLOSsel x KWS04, a population consisting of 2,780 F-2 individuals that does not segregate for Pl (ARG) . A large-insert sunflower bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was screened with overgo probes designed for markers RGC52 and RGC151, which cosegregated with Pl (ARG) . Two RGC-containing BAC contigs were anchored to the Pl (ARG) region on LG 1.									17	0	0	17	0	17			0040-5752			WOS:000283501900020	20700574

Modern electronic voting systems have made attempts to include disabled voters but have fallen short. Using recent developments in technology a secure, user centered, multimodal electronic voting system has been developed to study a multimodal approach for providing equity in access, privacy and security in electronic voting. This article will report findings from a study at the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind where more than thirty-five blind or visually impaired participants used the multimodal voting system. The findings suggest that the proposed multimodal approach to voting is easy to use and trustworthy.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1615-5289			WOS:000289363000005

Noradrenaline deters marine invertebrate biofouling when covalently bound in polymeric coatings								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				394	1-2			63	73		10.1016/j.jembe.2010.07.014			OCT 30 2010	2010	Marine biofouling is the unwanted accumulation of marine organisms on submerged structures and ships. Attempts to develop effective marine antifouling paints and coatings have had deleterious effects on marine and aquatic ecosystems. Current research efforts for designing an effective antifouling coating are focused on understanding the biology of the fouling organisms. Prior to settlement and metamorphosis, larvae of many marine invertebrates investigate surfaces using exploratory structures bearing an array of sensory cells. Interfering with these settlement and attachment mechanisms could be a promising alternative to existing antifouling strategies. Herein, we report the innovation of "fouling deterrence", an antifouling strategy in which marine invertebrate larval exploratory behaviors are exploited to defeat biofouling. Our approach is predicated upon larval recognition of covalently bound ligands, such as the catecholamine, noradrenaline which presents 'unfavorable' cues to deter larval settlement. To test this concept, we developed noradrenaline conjugated poly-HEMA (hydroxyethylmethacrylate) and poly-MAA (methacrylic acid) polymer systems. The bioactivity of covalently conjugated noradrenaline molecules was assessed using oyster hemocyte cellular assays followed by larval settlement assays using pediveliger larvae of the Eastern Oyster, Crassostrea virginica and the cyprid larvae of the barnacle, Balanus amphitrite. Noradrenaline conjugated polymer surfaces induced apoptosis in oyster hemocytes and deterred larval settlement in both oysters and barnacles.

Gao, Jia/I-4422-2013				Relationships between oxygenate and hydrocarbon formation during CO hydrogenation on Rh/SiO2: Use of multiproduct SSITKA								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				275	2			211	217		10.1016/j.jcat.2010.07.029			OCT 22 2010	2010	In the present research, the mechanism of C-1 and C-2 hydrocarbon and oxygenate formation during CO hydrogenation on Rh/SiO2 were for the first time investigated in detail using multiproduct SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis). This was also the first effort to explore at the site level the relationship between similar products [e.g., EtOH (ethanol) vs. AcH (acetaldehyde)] on Rh/SiO2. A fixed-bed differential reactor was used for CO hydrogenation and SSITKA at 250 degrees C and 1.8 atm. The selectivity to CH4 was higher than any other product, but the surface reaction residence time for CH4 formation was not the shortest among all the products. The surface reaction residence time for C-2 hydrocarbons was longer than that for any other product (C-1-C-2). Even though the selectivities to AcH and EtOH were similar, their surface reaction residence times differed significantly. Based on the SSITKA results, MeOH and CH4 appear to be produced on completely different active sites. Moreover, C-2 hydrocarbons do not appear to be formed from adsorbed AcH. It is likely, however, that all C-2 products share at least one intermediate with CH4, but none with MeOH. Several recently proposed pathways for EtOH and AcH formation are presented and compared to our results. The secondary reaction of AcH to form EtOH on the same sites does not appear to be a dominant pathway for EtOH formation. However, the precise mechanism for EtOH formation still needs further investigation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									15	1	0	0	0	16			0021-9517			WOS:000283687300004

These forms have diverged in larval ecology and reproductive behavior through unknown genetic mechanisms, despite considerable levels of hybridization. Previous genome-wide scans using gene-based microarrays uncovered divergence between M and S that was largely confined to gene-poor pericentromeric regions, prompting a speciation-with-ongoing-gene-flow model that implicated only about 3% of the genome near centromeres in the speciation process. Here, based on the complete M and S genome sequences, we report widespread and heterogeneous genomic divergence inconsistent with appreciable levels of interform gene flow, suggesting a more advanced speciation process and greater challenges to identify genes critical to initiating that process.									150	2	0	141	1	152			0036-8075			WOS:000283329100042	20966253

However, there is an energy penalty to enter subnanometer pores as ions have to shed part of their salvation shell. The magnitude of such an energy penalty plays a key role in determining the accessibility and charging/discharging of these subnanometer pores. Here, we report on the atomistic simulation of Na(+) and Cl(-) ions entering a polarizable slit pore with a center-to-center width of 0.82 tun We show that the free energy penalty for these ions to enter the pore is less than 14 kJ/mol for both Na(+) and Cl(-) ions. The surprisingly small energy penalty is caused by the van der Waals attractions between ions and pore walls, the image charge effects, the moderate (19-26%) dehydration of the ions inside the pore and the strengthened interactions between ions and their hydration water molecules in the subnanometer pore. The results provide strong impetus for further developing nanoporous electrodes featuring subnanometer pores.									33	1	0	2	0	33			1932-7447			WOS:000282855400102

Selenium- and sulfur-containing compounds can act as antioxidants, and coordination of selenium and sulfur to copper is one explanation for this antioxidant activity. To determine how copper coordination results in antioxidant activity, biologically relevant tris(pyrazolyl)methane and borate Cu+ complexes of the formulas Tp*Cu(L) and [Tpm(R)Cu(L)](+), where (L = N, W-dimethylimidazole selone, dmise; N, N'-dimethylimidazole thione, dmit; Tp* = hydrotris(3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl)borate; Tpm(R) = tris(pyrazolyl)methane, R = H; Tpm, R = Me; Tpm*, R = /Pr; TpmPr), have been synthesized and characterized. The structures of complexes Tp*Cu(Dmit), Tp*Cu(dmise), [Tpmtu(dmise)][BF(4)1, and [TpmRCu(Dmit)][BF(4)] (where R = H; Tpm, R = Me; Tpm*, R = /Pr; Tpm(Pr)) were determined by X-ray crystallography. All the Cu(+) centers adopt distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry, and Cu-Se and Cu-S distances for all the complexes are approximately 2.30 angstrom, and 2.20 angstrom, respectively. The effects of counterion and steric bulk at the 3 and 5 positions of the pyrazolyi ring on the structural and spectroscopic properties are discussed. Selone or thione coordination to copper significantly alters the Cu(+/2+) redox potential: Cu-selone complexes have Cu(2+/+) potentials from 283 to 390 mV, whereas those of Cuthione complexes range from 70 to 232 mV versus NHE. The Cu-selone complexes have Cu2(+/+) potentials near or below that of the cellular reductant NADH (-324 mV). Thus, selenium and sulfur coordination to copper in biological systems may prevent the Cu(2+) reduction by NADH required for the catalytic formation of damaging hydroxyl radical.									27	0	0	4	0	27			0020-1669			WOS:000282783400018	20836514

Because of its high-volatility, it is susceptible to loss through volatilization in high-temperature processing. Cyclodextrin (CD) inclusion complexation (IC) with volatile compounds can prevent losses of volatile compounds, because of volatilization. In this study, BHT was successfully included in beta-CD and its complex was confirmed using Wide-Angle X-ray Diffraction (WAXD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) films with BHT itself and BHT-beta-CD-IC were produced on a pilot plant scale. After extrusion, it was found that 44 and 78% BHT was lost from the BHT-beta-CD-IC LDPE and BHT LDPE films, respectively. Hence, the complex proved to be more efficient in preventing loss of BHT, because of encapsulation of volatile BHT. In addition, microscopy studies indicate that BHT-beta-CD-IC LDPE film shows small aggregates, uniformly distributed in the LDPE matrix over a large range. The BHT efficiency of the complex in the film was measured using DSC for determining the oxidation induction time. The oxidation induction time (OIT(time)) was 35 min for the BHT-beta-CD-IC LDPE film as compared with 16 mm and 26 min values of LDPE and BHT LDPE films, respectively. Hence, the encapsulation of BHT in beta-CD maximizes the efficiency and stability to thermal degradation for BHT-beta-CD-IC LDPE film. The viscoelastic behavior of the films was also studied using dynamic mechanical analysis. The results indicate increases in storage modulus (E(I)) and loss modulus (E(II)) of the complex and a shift in the maxima of tan delta (E(II)/E(I)) to lower temperature in the LDPE films processed with BHT, beta-CD, and BHT-beta-CD-IC.

The electrical and optical properties of the plasma jets and preliminary apoptosis results of cultured murine tumor cells and non-tumor fibroblast cells treated with the plasma jets are presented. The generated plasma jet was stable and enabled the treatment of cultured cells in cell culture plates regardless of the small inner diameter and low gas flow rate. The microplasma jet was observed inducing apoptosis in cultured murine melanoma tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the percentage of apoptotic cells of murine melanoma tumor cells induced by this plasma device was approximately 2.5 times bigger than that of murine fibroblast cells as indicated by an Annex V apoptosis assay. The apoptosis in cultured murine tumor cells by the 15-mu m-sized single-cellular-level and cell-manipulatable microplasma jet device was also observed using an in situ apoptosis assay. We report on a novel microplasma jet device with the advantages of single-cellular-level and single cell-manipulatable plasma treatment with precise and solid stimuli. This highly precise plasma medicine, which enables new directed cancer therapies can be combined with current cell manipulation and cell culturing technologies without much difficulty.

ACE-inhibitory activity was measured by HPLC assay. The 50% inhibitory concentrations of Arg-Val-Pro-Ser-Leu (RVPSL) was 20 mu M. Based on this remarkable ACE-inhibitory activity, it is suggested that RVPSL may have potential applications as a functional food, which could be used as nutraceutical compounds.

J	Rivera, Angela R. V.; Blob, Richard W.								Forelimb kinematics and motor patterns of the slider turtle (Trachemys scripta) during swimming and walking: shared and novel strategies for meeting locomotor demands of water and land								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				213	20			3515	3526		10.1242/jeb.047167			OCT 15 2010	2010	Turtles use their limbs during both aquatic and terrestrial locomotion, but water and land impose dramatically different physical requirements. How must musculoskeletal function be adjusted to produce locomotion through such physically disparate habitats? We addressed this question by quantifying forelimb kinematics and muscle activity during aquatic and terrestrial locomotion in a generalized freshwater turtle, the red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta), using digital high-speed video and electromyography (EMG). Comparisons of our forelimb data to previously collected data from the slider hindlimb allow us to test whether limb muscles with similar functional roles show qualitatively similar modulations of activity across habitats. The different functional demands of water and air lead to a prediction that muscle activity for limb protractors (e. g. latissimus dorsi and deltoid for the forelimb) should be greater during swimming than during walking, and activity in retractors (e. g. coracobrachialis and pectoralis for the forelimb) should be greater during walking than during swimming. Differences between aquatic and terrestrial forelimb movements are reflected in temporal modulation of muscle activity bursts between environments, and in some cases the number of EMG bursts as well. Although patterns of modulation between water and land are similar between the fore-and hindlimb in T. scripta for propulsive phase muscles (retractors), we did not find support for the predicted pattern of intensity modulation, suggesting that the functional demands of the locomotor medium alone do not dictate differences in intensity of muscle activity across habitats.									10	0	0	9	0	10			0022-0949			WOS:000282541800015	20889832

Hence studies of biological treatment of industrial wastewater should include investigation of the co-removal of these two pollutants. Brevibacterium casei, which can reduce Cr(VI) in the presence of the azo dye Acid Orange 7 (AO7) under nutrient-limiting condition, was isolated from a sewage sludge sample of a dyeing factory. Response surface methodology, which is commonly used to optimize growth conditions for food microorganisms to maximize product(s) yield, was used to determine the optimal conditions for chromate reduction and dye decolourization by B. casei. The optimal conditions were 0.24 g/L glucose, 3.0 g/L (NH(4))(2)SO(4) and 0.2 g/L peptone at pH 7 and 35 degrees C. The predicted maximum chromate reduction efficiencies and dye decolourization were 83.4 +/- 0.6 and 40.7 +/- 1.7%, respectively. A new mechanism was proposed for chromate reduction coupling with AO7 decolourization by B. casei. Under nutrient-limiting condition, AO7 was used as an e(-) donor by the reduction enzyme(s) of B. casei for the reduction of Cr(VI). The resulted Cr(III) then complexed with the oxidized AO7 to form a purple coloured intermediate. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The optical limiting threshold of CdS nanowires suspension was determined to be 1.3 J cm(-2), with normalized transmittance of 0.47, which is relatively lower when compared with those of many popular metal nanowire suspensions reported in the literature. Based on an effective three-photon absorption model, nonlinear absorption and nonlinear scattering were identified as the dominant processes for the measured reduced transmittance.

Three different NIST green tea standard reference materials (SRM 3254 Camellia sinesis Leaves, SRM 3255 C. sinesis Extract and SRM 3256 Green Tea-containing Oral Dosage Form) are characterized for the content of caffeine and a series of catechin species (gallic acid, catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)). The absolute limits of detection for caffeine and the catechin species were determined to be on the nanogram level. A reversed-phase chromatographic separation of the green tea reference materials was carried out on a commercial C(18) column using a gradient of water (containing 0.1% TFA) and 2:1 methanol:acetonitrile (containing 0.1%TFA) at 0.9 mL min(-1) and an analysis time of 50 min. Quantification of caffeine and the catechin species was carried out using the standard addition and internal standard methods, with the latter providing appreciable improvements in precision and recovery.

Dextran/Pluronic hydrogels were rapidly formed in situ under physiological conditions upon mixing the solutions of Dex-SH and PL-VS or PL-Ar at a PL concentration of 10 or 20 w/v%. Rheological studies showed that these hydrogels with a broad range of storage moduli of 0.3 to 80 kPa could be obtained by varying PL concentration from 5% to 20 w/v%. Moreover, the hydrogels at a PL concentration of 10% or 20 w/v% revealed thermosensitive property with a temperature increase from 10 to 37 degrees C. Dex-SH/PL-Ar hydrogels were degradable under physiological conditions and had lower cytotoxicity than Dex-SH/PL-VS hydrogels. These thermosensitive injectable hydrogels show promise for biomedical applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									24	2	0	6	0	25			0928-4931			WOS:000282905600023		
J	Chen, Qinglin; Liu, Shuaishuai; Tong, Chenning								Investigation of the subgrid-scale fluxes and their production rates in a convective atmospheric surface layer using measurement data								JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS				660				282	315		10.1017/S0022112010002752			OCT 10 2010	2010	The subgrid-scale (SGS) potential temperature flux and stress in the atmospheric surface layer are studied using field measurement data. We analyse the mean values of the SGS temperature flux, the SGS temperature flux production rate, the SGS temperature variance production rate, the SGS stress and the SGS stress production rate conditional on both the resolvable-scale velocity and temperature, which must be reproduced by SGS models for large-eddy simulation to reproduce the one-point resolvable-scale velocity temperature joint probability density function (JPDF). The results show that the conditional statistics generally depend on the resolvable-scale velocity and temperature fluctuations, indicating that these conditional variables have strong influences on the resolvable-scale statistics. The dependencies of the conditional SGS stress and the SGS stress production rate, which are partly due to the effects of flow history and buoyancy, suggest that model predictions of the SGS stress also affect the resolvable-scale temperature statistics. The results for the conditional flux and the conditional flux production rate vectors have similar trends. These conditional vectors are also well aligned. The positive temperature fluctuations associated with updrafts are found to have a qualitatively different influence on the conditional statistics than the negative temperature fluctuations associated with downdrafts. The conditional temperature flux and the temperature flux production rate predicted using several SGS models are compared with measurements in statistical a priori tests. The predictions using the nonlinear model are found to be closely related to the predictions using the Smagorinsky model. Several potential effects of the SGS model deficiencies on the resolvable-scale statistics, such as the overprediction of the vertical mean temperature gradient and the underprediction of the vertical temperature flux, are identified. The results suggest that efforts to improve the LES prediction of a resolvable-scale statistic must consider all the relevant SGS components identified using the JPDF equation and the surface layer dynamics. This study also provides impetus for further investigations of the JPDF equation, especially analytical studies on the relationship between the JPDF and the SGS terms that govern its evolution.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0022-1120			WOS:000283564000013

Interaction energy modeling has been used to predict the dispersibility of hydrophobically stabilized metal nanoparticles in GXLs but often overpredicts the mean particle size dispersed at a given solvent composition. More accurate and robust interaction energy models can be developed if the changes to both the ligand length and ligand solvation as a response to the composition of GXLs are better understood. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is a unique technique for nanoparticle characterization where in-situ ligand solvation measurements can be obtained by contrasting hydrogenated nanoparticle ligands with deuterated solvent. This study presents the first in-depth SANS measurements of ligand length and ligand solvation variation during nanoparticle antisolvent precipitation. The focus of this investigation is dodecanethiol-stabilized silver nanoparticles in carbon dioxide (CO(2))-expanded hexane. Upon pressurization with CO(2) antisolvent, the ligand length and ligand solvation for dodecanethiol-capped silver nanoparticles decrease as a function CO(2) composition in the GXL prior to nanoparticle precipitation. This work discusses the dependence of nanoparticle dispersibility as a function of CO(2) composition in n-hexane-d(14) GXL and the competing roles of ligand surface coverage, ligand length, and ligand solvation for nanoparticles with varying surface curvature.									12	0	0	1	0	12			1932-7447			WOS:000282209800030

This adsorption has been found to ubiquitously favor positively charged over negatively charged plastic beads due to the electrostatic attraction between the beads and the cellulose constituent of the model and living systems. Such a charge preference is especially pronounced for Chlorella and Scenedesmus, whose binding with the plastic beads-also depended upon algal morphology and motility, as characterized by the Freundlich coefficients. Using a CO(2) depletion assay, we show that the adsorption of plastic beads hindered algal photosynthesis, possibly through the physical blockage of light and air flow by the nanoparticles. Our ROS assay further indicated that plastic adsorption promoted algal ROS production. Such algal responses to plastic exposure may have implications on the sustainability of the aquatic food chain.									31	1	0	30	0	34			1932-7447			WOS:000282209800063

The duration of four developmental phases, emergence to bolting, bolting to flowering, flowering to silique production, and silique production to maturity, were recorded following wild radish sowing at monthly intervals from October 2004 through September 2006 Seedling emergence occurred 2 to 4 wk after sowing. Mortality of seedlings that emerged from December through March was greater than that of seedlings that emerged in all other months Wild radish that emerged from April through August completed its life cycle by summer or early autumn. Wild radish that emerged from September through November was able to survive the winter and complete its life cycle the following spring The developmental phases most affected by time of emergence were emergence to bolting and bolting to flowering. The duration of emergence to bolting ranged from 249 to 479 growing degree days (GDD), and bolting to flowering from 270 to 373 GDD, depending on the month of emergence. The total life cycle of wild radish varied from a low of 1,267 GDD following June emergence to 1,503 GDD following November emergence Multiple regression analysis revealed that emergence to bolting and silique production to maturity phases were dependent on accumulated heat units and photoperiod. Seed and biomass production were influenced by month of emergence An average of 1,470 seeds plant(-1) was produced when emergence occurred in July and 10,170 seeds plant (1) when emergence occurred in November Plants that emerged in autumn exhibited minimal growth during the winter months, but conditions were conducive for growth in mid-March and April, with biomass production of 809 g plant(-1) at silique production									4	0	0	3	0	4			0043-1745			WOS:000283693800006

However, this assessment is rendered more complicated by (a) the high rate of exclusion of people on the basis of behavioral characteristics and (b) the strikingly disparate impact of such decisions on people of color. America's high rates of (a) incarceration in the criminal and juvenile justice system, (b) visa denials, detention, and removal in the immigration system, and (c) suspensions and expulsions in the schools all have the effect of excluding many Latinos and African Americans from ordinary life in the community. Although norms of inclusion are adaptive for communities, such an approach is intrinsically difficult to achieve. Attention should be given to (a) facilitation of the exercise of moral leadership and (b) design of settings that "demand" notice of, and care for, all participants.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0002-9432			WOS:000283089900002	20964093

Applications of the dependency theory have been largely restricted to international scales; there is a dearth of studies conducted at smaller spatial scales. This study examines leakages of tourism revenues at four villages in Northern Thailand to illustrate the dependent relationship between a city and its rural hinterland. Study results are based on a survey of 43 small businesses and 40 interviews. Results indicate significant proportion of leakages of village revenues, between 15 and 61%, depending on several factors and strategies adopted by each village.									14	1	0	0	0	15			0160-7383			WOS:000282554000004

Two Pantoea spp. were isolated from DHM-1 that also possess this dechlorination capability. Following acclimation to increasing levels of CF, corn syrup-grown DHM-1 was able to transform over 500 mg/liter CF in the presence of vitamin B-12 (approximately 3% of CF on a molar basis) at a rate as high as 22 mg/liter/day in a mineral salts medium. CO, CO2, and organic acids were the predominant biodegradation products, suggesting that hydrolytic reactions predominate during CF transformation. DHM-1 was capable of growing on corn syrup in the presence of high concentrations of CF (as may be present near contaminant source zones in groundwater), which makes it a promising culture for bioaugmentation. Strains DHM-1B and DHM-1T transform CF at rates similar to that of the DHM-1 enrichment culture. The ability of these strains to grow in the presence of high concentrations of CF appears to be related to alteration of membrane fluidity or homeoviscous and homeophasic adaptation.									8	0	0	8	0	8			0099-2240			WOS:000282136700016	20693443

Results of the weighted least-squares approach are presented, along with comparisons using a Galerkin mixed method The numerical results indicate that with carefully chosen nonlinear weighting functions, the least-squares solution achieves an optimal convergence rate in the L(2)-norm for the approximation to each dependent variable for the generalized Newtonian problem For the viscoelastic flow problem, the numerical solution exhibits a second order convergence rate for the velocity and superlinear convergence rate in stress and pressure. Observed convergence rates depend strongly on the choice of weighting functions Least-squares solutions for flows through a 4-to-1 contraction channel are also considered (C) 2010 IMACS.

Head movements and simulator sickness generated by a virtual environment. Aviat Space Environ Med 2010; 81:929-34.Background: For virtual environments (VEs) to be useful in training it is important to understand the negative effects of VE exposure. The purpose of this study was to observe head movements in virtual and real environments and the relation between those movements and simulator sickness. Method: There were 48 men who were trained in 4-person teams in either a head-mounted display (HMD)-based VE or in a real world environment. Head position data were collected in both systems and simulator sickness scores were collected in the VE. The relationship of head movements and sickness scores in the VE was examined and the degree of head movements in the real world and VE compared. Results: Differences were found in the length of time subjects spent moving their heads; subjects with the highest sickness scores moved their heads less often than other subjects in the VE. Also, subjects moved their heads significantly less and less often in the VE (means: 30 degrees . 50 ms(-1), 71% of trial time not moving head), compared to the real world (means: 10 degrees . 50 ms(-1), 59% of trial time not moving head). Conclusions: This study observed that when head movements are quantified, past assumptions of the link between increased sickness scores and decreased head movements may not hold. Though not linked to simulator sickness, head movements were reduced in the VE compared to the real world. Though observational in nature, this study is one of the first to quantify head movements and how they may relate to simulator sickness.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0095-6562			WOS:000282149300004	20922884

We characterized cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of 18 +/- 5 nm PFBT conjugated polymer nanoparticles in 1774A.1 cells. Significant nanoparticle uptake was observed, indicating efficient nanoparticle entry into cells, even or short (1 h) incubations. The high fluorescence of these nanoparticles allows extremely low loading concentrations; PFBT. nanoparticle fluorescence in cells could be detected with loading concentrations of 155 pM (270 ppb). Cellular uptake slows at low temperature, consistent with endocytic entry. Nanoparticles colocalize with Texas Red dextrin and are trafficked to lysosomes, as demonstrated by the location of nanoparticle fluorescence in pet muck. organelles that also stain with an anti-LAMP-1 antibody. Inhibition of uptake by phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors implicates macropinocytosis as the operative endocytic mechanism. No significant cytotoxic or inflammatory effects could be observed, making PFBT nanoparticles attractive probes for live cell imaging.									88	3	0	27	0	90			1525-7797			WOS:000282840200018	20863132	
J	McDonell, Jim; Ott, Joyce; Mitchell, Margaret								Predicting dating violence victimization and perpetration among middle and high school students in a rural southern community								CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW				32	10			1458	1463		10.1016/j.childyouth.2010.07.001			OCT 2010	2010	Dating violence victimization and perpetration among young people in the rural South have been significantly understudied, despite evidence showing higher rates of dating violence in rural communities generally and in the southern U.S. states. This article reports the results of predictive models of dating violence victimization and perpetration among a convenience sample of middle and high school students in a rural South Carolina community. Logistic regression analyses showed that female victimization was predicted by knowing a female victim, substance use, attitudes towards violence, and grade level in school. Male victimization was predicted by knowing a male perpetrator, substance use, attitudes towards violence, and the acceptability of violence-related behaviors in the family. Female perpetration was predicted by knowing a male perpetrator, substance use, and attitudes towards violence while male perpetration was predicted by juvenile justice involvement, attitudes towards violence, and the acceptability of violence-related behaviors in dating and family relationships. Implications for further research and prevention efforts are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									15	0	0	1	2	16			0190-7409			WOS:000281998400033

Under a locational choice model in which products are differentiated both horizontally (by variety attributes) and vertically (by quality attributes), an optimal assortment, whose attributes have only been partially characterized, may consist of multiple quality levels. Using previous analytical results, we approximate the optimal assortment for make-to-order and static substitution environments. We test the appropriateness and compare the performance of three metaheuristic methods.

(Lepidoptera: Crambidae), management in Louisiana sugarcane								CROP PROTECTION				29	10			1168	1176		10.1016/j.cropro.2010.06.004			OCT 2010	2010	On-farm field experiments were conducted in 2004 and 2007 to assess the suitability of novaluron, a chitin synthesis inhibitor, for sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.), management in Louisiana sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids). Aerial insecticide applications reproducing commercial production practices were made when D. saccharalis infestation levels exceeded a recommended action threshold. In addition to decreased D. saccharalis infestations, 6.3 - 14.5-fold reductions in end of season injury, expressed as the percentage of bored sugarcane internodes, were observed in plots treated with novaluron. D. saccharalis control in novaluron plots was equivalent to (P > 0.05) or better (P < 0.05) than that achieved with tebufenozide, an ecdysone agonist that has been extensively used for over a decade on sugarcane. With a numerical trend of a 3.1-fold decrease in percent bored internodes, the pyrethroid gamma-cyhalothrin seemed less effective than the biorational insecticides in protecting sugarcane against D. saccharalis. Using continuous pitfall trap sampling, no measurable (P > 0.05) decreases in predaceous and non-predaceous soil-dwelling non-target arthropods were associated with insecticides. However, numerical trends for decreases in immature crickets associated with novaluron and gamma-cyhalothrin were recorded in 2007. Our data suggest that novaluron will fit well in Louisiana sugarcane integrated pest management. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									8	0	0	7	0	8			0261-2194			WOS:000282353000017

This paper studies the effects of changes in education benefits using data of the period 1990-2005. Higher benefits lead to higher separation due to both pure incentive effects and by attracting more college-oriented youth into military service. We deal with potential selection issues by distinguishing between anticipated and unanticipated benefit changes. Higher education benefits are associated with higher separation from the Army and Air Force, but not the other services. A $10,000 increase in MGIB benefits is estimated to increase usage by about 5 percentage points, but the duration of usage is estimated to be insensitive to benefit levels.

Polymerized Ionic Liquid Sorbents for CO2 Separation								ENERGY & FUELS				24				5797	5804		10.1021/ef101027s			OCT 2010	2010	This contribution describes a method to prepare adsorbent materials for recovery of carbon dioxide from mixed gases. The sorbents comprise a base support material and a covalently attached nanolayer coating of polymerized ionic liquid (pIL), poly([2-(methylacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride) (poly[(M ETA)50 D. Initial measurements were made to determine the thickness evolution of the pIL nanolayers, using a model substrate designed to mimic the structure of the support material. Thereafter, the pIL was grafted from the surface of the support material using surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization. Subsequent ion exchange was done to replace Cl- anions with other anions to study the impact of pIL. anion on CO2 adsorption; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results confirmed that the ion-exchange reactions were quantitative. Anions that were tested were BF4-, CH3SO3- and CF3SO3-. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured from 0 to 2.5 bar at temperatures from 20 to 60 degrees C using a Wicke-Kallenbach cell. Measurements with N-2 showed no measurable adsorption at the highest pressure studied. Measurements on unmodified support material also showed no CO2 uptake. CO2 adsorbed to pIL-modified substrates with linear isotherms over the pressure range studied. Using the adsorption isotherm data at low pressures. Henry's constants and heats of adsorption were measured. From these values, it was found that anions play a marginal role in CO2 adsorption performance by these trimethylammonium-based pIL sorbents. Despite their high CO2/N-2 selectivity, the capacity values of the neat pIL materials were modest, Even for a relatively high CO2 partial pressure of 0.78 bar, representing a pressure-swing operation used to process flue gas with 13 mol % CO2 at 6 bar, the poly[(META)+CF3SO3-]pIL had a capacity of 2 mmollg on the basis of per mass of 11 Opportunities Opportunities exist for improving sorbent performance by changing polymer surface chemistry, and the synthesis methodology presented in this study can be applied to prepare a wide range of functional materials and yield new materials for CO2 separations.									15	0	0	2	0	15			0887-0624			WOS:000283111200058

Effects of Adjacent Habitat on Populations of Stink Bugs (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) in Cotton as Part of a Variable Agricultural Landscape in South Carolina								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				39	5			1420	1427		10.1603/EN09194			OCT 2010	2010	The distribution of phytophagous stink bugs and associated boll injury in margins of cotton fields bordering various agronomic crops and woodlands were studied in 2007 and 2008. Two commercial cotton fields, ranging in size from 7.8 to 12.1 ha in Barnwell and Lee Counties, SC, were sampled weekly each year along predetermined transects at 0, 5, 10, and 25 m from the outside margin into the cotton field. Stink bugs were sampled using a ground cloth (0.91 by 0.91 m), and quarter-sized bolls (approximate to 2.5 cm in diameter) were collected and examined for internal damage. Density (bugs/row-m) of total stink bugs (adults plus nymphs) was greatest in cotton adjacent to peanut. Boll injury was significantly greater in cotton adjacent to soybean and peanut than in cotton next to other habitats, including corn, cotton, and woodlands, during midseason. Density of nymphs was greatest in cotton adjacent to peanut during mid and late season. Densities of total stink bugs and adults were greatest in cotton immediately adjacent (0 m) to all bordering crops and decreased as distance from the margin increased. Boll injury was greatest in cotton immediately adjacent (0 m) to the bordering crop in mid and late season. Because densities of stink bugs and boll injury vary spatially and temporally along field margins of cotton and can vary significantly based on the adjacent crop, such factors should be considered when developing integrated pest management strategies in cotton.									20	0	0	20	0	20			0046-225X			WOS:000282852600004	22546436

H(2)O(2) and induced chemical species (e.g. polysulfide, ROS) and redox potential shift increased the expressions of the genes involved in detoxification, thioredoxin-dependent reduction system, protein and DNA repair, and decreased those involved in sulfate reduction, lactate oxidation and protein synthesis. A gene coexpression network analysis revealed complicated network interactions among differentially expressed genes, and suggested possible importance of several hypothetical genes in H(2)O(2) stress. Also, most of the genes in PerR and Fur regulons were highly induced, and the abundance of a Fur regulon protein increased. Mutant analysis suggested that PerR and Fur are functionally overlapped in response to stresses induced by H(2)O(2) and reaction products, and the upregulation of thioredoxin-dependent reduction genes was independent of PerR or Fur. It appears that induction of those stress response genes could contribute to the increased resistance of deletion mutants to H(2)O(2)-induced stresses. In addition, a conceptual cellular model of D. vulgaris responses to H(2)O(2) stress was constructed to illustrate that this bacterium may employ a complicated molecular mechanism to defend against the H(2)O(2)-induced stresses.									20	1	0	20	0	21			1462-2912			WOS:000282375400002	20482586

Sorption affinity in the absence of chelating ligands followed: Am(III) > Co(II) > Cs(I) > Sr(II). The presence of chelating ligands generally had little effect on sorption of (85)Sr and (137)Cs with K(d) values 110 and 690 mLg(-1), respectively. But at 0.02 M of ethylenediaminetetraacetic or hydroxyethyliminodiacetic, the K(d) decreased to 5 or 63 mL g(-1) respectively, where thermochemical modeling indicated almost all (85)Sr is complexed with these ligands. The K(d) values for (241)Am and (60)Co generally decreased with increasing chelating agent concentrations. In notable cases, the K(d) values for Am increased at specific concentrations of 10(-3) M for IDA, MIDA and 10(-4) M for EDDA. This is proposed to be due to formation of a ternary surface complex.

In this study, Chinese propolis ethyl acetate extract (PEAE) was evaluated to control P digitatum and P italicum on postharvest citrus fruits. The results indicated PEAE strongly inhibited mycelia growth and induced hyphae prominent abnormal morphological alterations. Also, PEAE had strong detrimental effect on spore germination of the tested pathogens in a concentration-dependent manner. For in vivo tests, PEAE could both reduce decay caused by P digitatum and P italicum respectively in wound-inoculated fruit and naturally infected fruit; meanwhile, no negative influences on the overall quality of the citrus fruits were observed with PEAE treatment. Therefore, PEAE could be used as a natural antifungal agent to control citrus blue and green mold.									10	3	0	4	0	13			1226-7708			WOS:000283904600025

VOCs provide customized, homogeneous execution environments on a per-Virtual Organization basis, without the cost of physical cluster construction or the overhead of per-job containers. Administrative access and overlay network capabilities are granted to Virtual Organizations (VOs) that choose to implement VOC technology, while the system remains completely transparent to end users and non-participating VOs. Unlike existing systems that require explicit leases, VOCs are autonomically self-provisioned and self-managed according to configurable usage policies.The work presented here contains two parts: a technology-agnostic formal model that describes the properties of VOCs and a prototype implementation of a physical cluster with hosted VOCs, based on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. Test results demonstrate the feasibility of VOCs for use with high-throughput grid computing jobs. With the addition of a "watchdog" daemon for monitoring scheduler queues and adjusting VOC size, the results also demonstrate that cloud computing environments can be autonomically self-provisioned in response to changing workload conditions.

Genetics of species differences in sailfin and shortfin mollies								HEREDITY				105	4			370	383		10.1038/hdy.2009.166			OCT 2010	2010	Premating reproductive isolation is a strong barrier to hybridization in natural populations, but little is known about the genetic mechanisms that allow changes in mating signals to develop and whether different components of a mating signal can evolve in concert when sexual selection favors phenotypic associations between them. In this study, we report results suggesting that changes in a behavioural trait (courtship display) and multiple phenotypically associated morphological traits (dorsal fin characters and length of the gonopodium) have contributed to divergence in mating signals used by sailfin mollies. Through the use of reciprocal F1 and backcross hybrids, we show that morphological traits important in separating sailfin from shortfin molly species have a genetic basis and are inherited in an autosomal, additive manner. We also report significant associations between the size of certain morphological traits (length of the dorsal fin and length of the gonopodium) and the tendency of males to perform courtship displays or gonopodial thrusts. In particular, higher courtship display rates were associated with increased dorsal fin length but decreased gonopodium length, characteristics most similar to sailfin species. Such phenotypic associations between different components of a mating signal suggest that selective forces can act in concert on multiple aspects of the signal, hence, promoting divergence and speciation in sailfin mollies.

Of nine simuliid-borne animal diseases, only two, mansonellosis and onchocerciasis, afflict humans. Onchocerciasis is a debilitating disease infecting an estimated 40 million people in Africa, Latin America, and Yemen, whereas mansonellosis is a mild disease in the Neotropics. Cytogenetic studies of natural populations of more than 500 species of black flies have revealed that the classic morphospecies of taxonomists is typically a complex of two or more reproductively isolated entities, or sibling (cryptic) species. Most vectors of human pathogens are sibling species, each ecologically unique in traits such as breeding habitats, dispersal capabilities, and degree of vector competence. We review the evolution of black flies, the cytogenetics that have revealed about 260 cytologically distinct entities, the molecular studies that continue to expose additional hidden biodiversity, and a case study of the epidemiology of the Simulium damnosum complex, the largest species complex of blood-feeding arthropods on Earth and the premier group of black flies responsible for human onchocerciasis.

It's About Time: Divergence, Demography, and the Evolution of Developmental Modes in Marine Invertebrates								INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY				50	4			643	661		10.1093/icb/icq068			OCT 2010	2010	Differences in larval developmental mode are predicted to affect ecological and evolutionary processes ranging from gene flow and population bottlenecks to rates of population recovery from anthropogenic disturbance and capacity for local adaptation. The most powerful tests of these predictions use comparisons among species to ask how phylogeographic patterns are correlated with the evolution and loss of prolonged planktonic larval development. An important and largely untested assumption of these studies is that interspecific differences in population genetic structure are mainly caused by differences in dispersal and gene flow (rather than by differences in divergence times among populations or changes in effective population sizes), and that species with similar patterns of spatial genetic variation have similar underlying temporal demographic histories. Teasing apart these temporal and spatial patterns is important for understanding the causes and consequences of evolutionary changes in larval developmental mode. New analytical methods that use the coalescent history of allelic diversity can reveal these temporal patterns, test the strength of traditional population-genetic explanations for variation in spatial structure based on differences in dispersal, and identify strongly supported alternative explanations for spatial structure based on demographic history rather than on gene flow alone. We briefly review some of these recent analytical developments, and show their potential for refining ideas about the correspondence between the evolution of larval developmental mode, population demographic history, and spatial genetic variation.

The enhancement scheme is based on exciting the sensor at the clamped end using a delayed-feedback signal obtained by measuring the tip deflection of the sensor. The gain and delay of the feedback signal are chosen such that the base excitations set the beam into stable limit-cycle oscillations as a result of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation of the trivial fixed points. The amplitude of these limit-cycles is shown to be ultrasensitive to parameter variations and, hence, can be utilized for the detection of minute changes in the resonant frequency of the sensor. The first part of the manuscript delves into the theoretical understanding of the proposed mechanism and the operation concept. Using the method of multiple scales, an approximate analytical solution for the steady-state limit-cycle amplitude near the stability boundaries is obtained. This solution is then utilized to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effect of small frequency variations on the limit-cycle amplitude and the sensitivity of these limit-cycles to different design parameters. Once a deep theoretical understanding is established, the manuscript provides an experimental study to investigate the proposed concept. Experimental results demonstrate orders of magnitude sensitivity enhancement over the traditional frequency-shift method.

Depth discrete measurements of K-d were made for a suite of radionuclides (Cd-109, Co-57, Co-60, Sr-85, Cs-137, and Y-88) utilizing a sediment core from the E-Area at the Savannah River Site. The K-d's were ordered as Sr-85(2+) < Cs-137(+) < Cd-109(2+) < Co-57(2+) = Co-60(2+) << Y-88(3+) and the values generally fell below or near the lowest quartile of values reported in the literature. Correlations were generally weak between soil properties and K-d values. Most importantly, all of the K-d distributions could be reasonably approximated as log-normal. Deterministic and stochastic calculations of contaminant travel time to the water table were made. The deterministic calculations were based on each of three conceptual models of the vadose zone: complete stratification (17 strata, each with a different K-d), two strata (two sections of the vadose zone, each characterized by a single, average K-d), and unstratified (a single zone with an average K-d). Stochastic calculations were based on log-normal fits to the K-d data. The two strata model generally yielded travel times 2x greater than those in the completely stratified model. The unstratified model yielded travel times that were between 3 and 5 times greater than the completely stratified model. The stochastic mean travel times were comparable to those of the two strata model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0265-931X			WOS:000281083000010	20627380	
J	Herran, C. Leigh; Wang, Wei; Huang, Yong; Mironov, Vladimir; Markwald, Roger								Parametric Study of Acoustic Excitation-Based Glycerol-Water Microsphere Fabrication in Single Nozzle Jetting								JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				132	5					051001	10.1115/1.4002187			OCT 2010	2010	Microspheres or droplets are increasingly finding various biomedical applications as drug microspheres and multicellular spheroids. Single nozzle-based continuous jetting with the help of acoustic excitation and/or carrier stream is a basic process for mono-disperse microsphere fabrication. Precise control of microsphere size and size distribution in single nozzle jetting is still of great manufacturing interest. The objective of this study is to numerically model a glycerol-water microsphere fabrication process during acoustic excitation-based single nozzle continuous jetting. Using a volume of fluid method, this study has investigated the effects of material properties and fabrication conditions such as the acoustic excitation frequency and amplitude and the carrier stream velocity on the size of microspheres fabricated. (1) The microsphere diameter decreases as the glycerol volume percentage increases. (2) The excitation frequency and pressure have a pronounced effect on the microsphere size. The microsphere diameter decreases as the excitation frequency increases, and the microsphere diameter increases with the excitation pressure amplitude. (3) The microsphere size decreases as the carrier stream velocity increases. [DOI:10.1115/1.4002187]									5	1	0	1	0	6			1087-1357			WOS:000282697000001

Influence of Antistripping Additives on Moisture Susceptibility of Warm Mix Asphalt Mixtures								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING				22	10			1047	1055		10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000111			OCT 2010	2010	Rising energy prices, global warming, and more stringent environmental regulations have resulted in an interest in warm mix asphalt (WMA) technologies as a means to decrease the energy consumption and emissions associated with conventional hot mix asphalt production. However, the utilization of the hydrated lime and liquid antistripping agents (ASA) in WMA mixture makes these issues more complicated. The objective of this study was to investigate and evaluate the moisture susceptibility of the mixtures containing ASA and WMA additives. The experimental design for this study included the utilizations of one binder source (PG 64-22), three ASA additives and control, two WMA additives and virgin, and three aggregate sources. A total of 36 types of mixtures and 216 specimens were fabricated and tested in this study. The performed properties include indirect tensile strength (ITS), tensile strength ratio (TSR), flow, and toughness. The results indicated that the hydrate lime exhibits the best moisture resistance for WMA mixtures, the liquid ASA additives can increase the ITS values of the mixtures but the liquid ASA generally exhibits a weak moisture resistance compared to the hydrate lime regardless of WMA and aggregate types in this study. In addition, the wet ITS values of mixtures containing WMA additives were lower than that of the mixtures without WMA additives.									37	1	0	0	1	38			0899-1561			WOS:000281870700012		
J	Sen, Chiradeep; Ameri, Farhad; Summers, Joshua D.				Summers, Joshua/B-7362-2009	Summers, Joshua/0000-0002-6129-2663			An Entropic Method for Sequencing Discrete Design Decisions								JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN				132	10					101004	10.1115/1.4002387			OCT 2010	2010	This paper presents a mathematical model for quantifying uncertainty of a discrete design solution and to monitor it through the design process. In the presented entropic view, uncertainty is highest at the beginning of the process as little information is known about the solution. As additional information is acquired or generated, the solution becomes increasingly well-defined and uncertainty reduces, finally diminishing to zero at the end of the process when the design is fully defined. In previous research, three components of design complexity-size, coupling, and solvability-were identified. In this research, these metrics are used to model solution uncertainty based on the search spaces of the variables (size) and the compatibility between variable values (coupling). Solvability of the variables is assumed uniform for simplicity. Design decisions are modeled as choosing a value, or a reduced set of values, from the existing search space of a variable, thus, reducing its uncertainty. Coupling is measured as the reduction of a variable's search space as an effect of reducing the search space of another variable. This model is then used to monitor uncertainty reduction through a design process, leading to three strategies that prescribe deciding the variables in the order of their uncertainty, number of dependents, or the influence of on other variables. Comparison between these strategies shows how size and coupling of variables in a design can be used to determine task sequencing strategy for fast design convergence.

The Community Reinvestment Act and Targeted Mortgage Lending								JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING				42	7			1351	1372		10.1111/j.1538-4616.2010.00344.x			OCT 2010	2010	We analyze residential mortgage lending by banks in periods surrounding upgrades or downgrades in their ratings under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Empirical results indicate that upgraded banks had higher relative levels of lending than did downgraded banks prior to ratings changes. Additionally, both downgraded and upgraded banks increased lending following implementation of reforms to the CRA in the 1990s, which were intended to more closely align rating assessment with lending outcomes. Little support is provided, on the other hand, for a hypothesis that banks respond to downgrades by increasing lending (despite apparent incentives for them to do so).									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-2879	1538-4616		WOS:000281658200006		
J	Hazari, Zahra; Sonnert, Gerhard; Sadler, Philip M.; Shanahan, Marie-Claire								Connecting High School Physics Experiences, Outcome Expectations, Physics Identity, and Physics Career Choice: A Gender Study								JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING				47	8			978	1003		10.1002/tea.20363			OCT 2010	2010	This study explores how students' physics identities are shaped by their experiences in high school physics classes and by their career outcome expectations. The theoretical framework focuses on physics identity and includes the dimensions of student performance, competence, recognition by others, and interest. Drawing data from the Persistence Research in Science and Engineering (PRiSE) project, which surveyed college English students nationally about their backgrounds, high school science experiences, and science attitudes, the study uses multiple regression to examine the responses of 3,829 students from 34 randomly selected US colleges/universities. Confirming the salience of the identity dimension for young persons' occupational plans, the measure for students' physics identity used in this study was found to strongly predict their intended choice of a physics career. Physics identity, in turn, was found to correlate positively with a desire for an intrinsically fulfilling career and negatively with a desire for personal/family time and opportunities to work with others. Physics identity was also positively predicted by several high school physics characteristics/experiences such as a focus on conceptual understanding, real-world/contextual connections, students answering questions or making comments, students teaching classmates, and having an encouraging teacher. Even though equally beneficial for both genders, females reported experiencing a conceptual focus and real-world/contextual connections less frequently. The explicit discussion of under-representation of women in science was positively related to physics identity for female students but had no impact for male students. Surprisingly, several experiences that were hypothesized to be important for females' physics identity were found to be non-significant including having female scientist guest speakers, discussion of women scientists' work, and the frequency of group work. This study exemplifies a useful theoretical framework based on identity, which can be employed to further examine persistence in science, and illustrates possible avenues for change in high school physics teaching.

Blast-wave impact-mitigation capability of polyurea when used as helmet suspension-pad material								MATERIALS & DESIGN				31	9			4050	4065		10.1016/j.matdes.2010.05.002			OCT 2010	2010	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is generally considered as a signature injury of the current military conflicts, with costly and life-altering long-term effects. Hence, there is an urgent need to combat this problem by both gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the blast-induced TBI and by designing/developing more effective head protection systems. In the present work, the blast-wave impact-mitigation ability of polyurea when used as a helmet suspension-pad material is investigated computationally. Towards that end, a combined Eulerian/Lagrangian fluid/solid transient non-linear dynamics computational analysis is carried out at two levels of blast peak overpressure: (a) one level corresponding to the unprotected-lung- injury-threshold; and (b) the other level associated with the corresponding 50% lethal dose (LD(50)), i.e. with a 50% probability for lung-injury induced death. To assess the blast-wave impact-mitigation ability of polyurea, the temporal evolution of the axial stress and the particle (axial) velocity at different locations within the intra-cranial cavity are analyzed. The results are compared with their counterparts obtained in the case of a conventional foam suspension-pad material. This comparison showed that, the use of polyurea suspension pads is associated with a substantially greater reduction in the peak loading experienced by the brain relative to that observed in the case of the conventional foam. The observed differences in the blast-wave mitigation capability of the conventional foam and polyurea are next rationalized in terms of the differences in their microstructure and in their mechanical response when subjected to blast loading.

Commercial watermelon 'Fiesta' (diploid seeded) and 'Tri-X 313' (triploid seedless) scions were grafted onto the rootstocks in 2007 and 2008, respectively. In 2007, the plants grafted on rootstock from the wild watermelon germplasm line RKVL 318 had significantly less (P < 0.05) root galling than nongrafted 'Fiesta' watermelon or plants with the squash hybrid or bottle gourd rootstocks. In 2008, 'Fiesta' plants with rootstocks from all five wild watermelon germplasm lines and the commercial watermelon rootstock had significantly less (P < 0.05) root galling than plants with the squash hybrid or bottle gourd rootstocks. Root galling of the squash hybrid and bottle gourd rootstocks was severe (78 to 99%) in both years. Root galling for nongrafted 'Fiesta' and 'Tri-X 313' watermelon was 36 and 50%, respectively. Root galling for the wild watermelon germplasm lines ranged from 11 to 34% and 36 to 44% in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Wild watermelon germplasm lines derived from C. lanatus var. citroides were identified that may be useful as resistant rootstocks for managing root-knot nematodes in watermelon.									37	1	0	31	2	38			0191-2917			WOS:000282012900003

We characterized one apricot (Pa_GBa141J23) and one peach (Pp_NBa103A15) BAC clone harboring a TFL1 gene. Sequence analysis revealed that the apricot and peach TFL1 (PaTFL1 and PpTFL1) genes display a similar exon-intron organization to homologs from other eudicot species and the defined amino acid domains are preserved. Phylogenetic analysis grouped PaTFL1 and PpTFL1 with the Arabidopsis ortholog. Numerous cis-elements present in the upstream regulatory region of the Arabidopsis TFl1 were identified in the PaTFL1 and PpTFL1 promoter regions. Two TFL1 alleles involving SSR polymorphism exist in the 'Nemared' peach cultivar. All nine genes annotated in the apricot Pa_GBa141J23 BAC have the same gene order in the peach genome. Syntenic regions are present in angiosperm species around the TFL1 locus, with the size of syntenic region decreasing from eudicots to monocots. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Influence of supplemental dietary poultry fat, phytase, and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol on the egg characteristics of commercial layers inoculated before or at the onset of lay with F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum								POULTRY SCIENCE				89	10			2078	2082		10.3382/ps.2010-00780			OCT 1 2010	2010	The effects of supplemental dietary poultry fat (PF), phytase (PHY), and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (D(3)) on the egg characteristics of commercial layers inoculated with F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum (FMG) were investigated in 2 trials. Sham and FMG inoculations were administered at 12 (before lay) and 22 (onset of lay) wk and 4 dietary treatments [basal control diet (BCD); BCD with 0.75% supplemental PF; BCD with 1.50% supplemental PF; BCD with 1.50% supplemental PF, 0.013% PHY, and 0.025% D(3)] were initiated at 20 wk of age. Percentages of albumen, yolk, and eggshell weights; yolk: albumen ratio; yolk moisture and lipid concentrations; and eggshell weight per unit of surface area were determined at 24, 34, 44, 50, and 58 wk of age. Inoculation with FMG reduced yolk lipid concentration at wk 24 and increased yolk moisture concentration at wk 58. In birds inoculated on wk 22, percentage of yolk weight was lower in those inoculated with FMG compared with those that were sham-inoculated. Yolk: albumen ratio was lower in birds that were FMG-inoculated at 22 wk of age compared with those that were sham-inoculated at the same age or that were FMG-inoculated at 12 wk of age. Percentage of yolk weight was greater in birds inoculated at wk 22 and fed the BCD with 1.50% supplemental PF treatment compared with those inoculated at wk 22 and fed the BCD or BCD with 1.50% supplemental PF, 0.013% PHY, and 0.025% D(3) treatments and compared with birds inoculated at wk 12 and fed the BCD with 0.75% supplemental PF treatment. In conclusion, inoculation with FMG before or at the onset of lay caused a decrease in yolk lipid content early in lay but an increase in yolk moisture late in lay, and FMG reduced percentage of yolk weight in birds inoculated on wk 22. Furthermore, when used in combination with added 1.50% PF in birds inoculated on wk 22, supplementary PHY and D(3) prevented an increase in percentage of yolk weight that occurred in response to diets supplemented only with 1.50% PF.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0032-5791			WOS:000281968100005	20852097

Changes in yield classification in a soybean-rice rotation								PRECISION AGRICULTURE				11	5			507	519		10.1007/s11119-009-9143-z			OCT 2010	2010	For yield based site-specific management to be successful in fields with crop rotations, changes in management zones between crops must be determined. The study objectives were to determine if yield classes change between crops within a rotation and whether soil properties can predict the yield classes or the year-to-year changes. A percentile classification method was used to categorize yearly soybean (Glycine max) and rice (Oryza sativa) yield in two fields with soybean-rice-soybean rotations into low, medium and high yield classes. There was little agreement in yield classifications between years. Yield class based on soil properties was predicted accurately by linear discriminant analysis in Field 1 20-67% of the time and in Field 2 13-83% of the time. Predictions in Field 1 were based on soil available Mg and P, elevation and the deep soil apparent electrical conductivity (EC(a)). Predictions in Field 2 were based on soil texture, soil available P, K and Mg, and pH. The linear discriminant analysis was also able to predict year-to-year changes in yield class. Changes in class in Field 1 could be predicted by total soil C and N, silt, and soil available Mg and P depending on the year. Soil texture, soil available P, K and Mg, total soil C and pH, elevation and deep soil EC(a) predicted yield changes in Field 2 depending on the year. The results of this study indicate only limited success at management zone definition in a soybean-rice rotation. Further investigation is needed with other crop rotation sequences to verify the findings of this study.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-2256			WOS:000281793500006

The records are the first in the Western Hemisphere for this potentially important Old World pest of sugarcane and certain other graminoid crops. Host plants on Guana were Chloris barbata Sw. (swollen fingergrass), C. radiata (L.) (radiate fingergrass), Cynodon dactylon L. (bermudagrass), and Saccharum officinarum L. (sugarcane). A probable mealybug predator associated with colonies of P. saccharicola on all three islands was the hyperaspidine coccinellid Hyperaspis scutifera (Mulsant), previously recorded in the West Indies only from the Leeward Antilles (Curacao). Both the mealybug and lady beetle are considered adventive in the BVI. Diagnoses and illustrations of both species are provided to facilitate their recognition. Hyperaspis sanctaeritae Dobzhansky, 1941, described from Arizona, USA, is proposed (by N.J.V.) as a junior synonym of H. scutifera (Mulsant 1850).									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-8797			WOS:000286355600011

The flash point decreased and moisture content increased upon addition of alcohols to poultry fat methyl esters. The alcohol type did not result in a statistically significant difference in low temperature performance at similar blend ratios in poultry fat methyl esters. In addition, blends of ethanol in poultry fat methyl esters afforded the least viscous mixtures, whereas isopropanol and butanol blends were progressively more viscous, but still within specifications contained in ASTM 06751 and EN 14214. Blends of alcohols in poultry fat methyl esters resulted in failure of the flash point specifications found in ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. Flash points of butanol blends were superior to those of isopropanol and ethanol blends, with the 5 vol.% butanol blend exhibiting a flash point (57 degrees C) superior to that of No. 2 diesel fuel (52 degrees C). Blends of alcohols in poultry fat methyl esters resulted in an improvement in acid value with increasing content of alcohol. An increase in moisture content of biodiesel was observed with increasing alcohol content, with the effect being more pronounced in ethanol blends versus isopropanol and butanol blends. Finally, none of the alcohol-methyl ester samples exhibited a phase separation at sub-ambient temperatures. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It is also found in remnant populations in the eastern United States, including North and South Carolina, often in association with other species with prairie affinities. We characterized eight A. gerardii population sites across various physiographic regions of North and South Carolina. A total of 362 quadrats (1 m x 1 m) were sampled during the 2006-2008 growing seasons for species occurrence and site and quadrat frequency. Associated species were assigned a commonness index (CI). A Sorensen's Community Coefficient was used to determine floristic similarities among the sites. In addition, soil samples in three quadrats were sampled at each site at three depths (0-10 cm, 11-20 cm, and 21-30 cm) and analyzed for pH; organic C and N contents; extractable P. K, Ca, Mg, Zn, Mn; and CEC (cation exchange capacity). A total of 306 vascular plant species was identified comprising 64 families, including 99 (32%) graminoids. There were 61(20%) Poaceae and 63 (20%) Asteraceae. Species per quadrat ranged from 1 to 13 with a mean of 5. Andropogon gerardii had the highest CI value (5900), followed by Rubus spp. (1260). Community Coefficient values were < 0.5 for all pairings between sites, indicating high divergence in species composition among even nearby sites. There were 14 rare or watch-listed species identified, including the federal endangered Helianthus schweinitzii at Troy Prairie. A total of 153(50%) of the species had been previously described as occurring in prairie-like associations. Soil pH values varied from 4.8 to 6.9 among the sites and depths. Ca and Mg nutrient values were also highly variable. Andropogon gerardii was found at high frequencies across all sites, indicating its broad tolerance for a variety of edaphic conditions.									4	0	0	5	0	5			0035-4902			WOS:000288284800003

Following after-ripening in winter, seeds experienced a reduction in dormancy and germinated higher at 25 to 35 C mean compared with 10 to 15 C mean With after-ripening for an additional 3 mo in May, seeds experienced a broadening of thermal range (10 to 40 C mean), and germination in natural light or R light was more than twice the germination in the absence of light. Fluctuating temperatures (7 5 C amplitude) improved germination over constant temperatures, except in summer and fall (9 and 12 mo after seed maturation) Exposure of seeds to high temperatures during summer caused secondary dormancy induction. Averaged over thermal amplitudes, seeds retrieved in fall required mean temperatures > 25 C for increased germination. Burial in spring for 3 to 6 mo induced seed dormancy, and the relative germination in fall (12 mo after seed maturation) was at least 50% higher for seeds retrieved from soil surface compared to seeds exhumed from 10-cm soil depth Seeds retrieved in late summer and fall required natural light or R light for promoting germination, whereas far-red (FR) light or darkness inhibited germination Furthermore, the effect of R and FR light was reversible, indicating a partially phytochrome-mediated germination response of Palmer amaranth seeds following 9 to 12 mo of after-ripening in the field									13	0	0	12	2	14			0043-1745			WOS:000283693800010

Effectiveness of Financial Incentive Programs in Promoting Sustainable Forestry in the West								WESTERN JOURNAL OF APPLIED FORESTRY				25	4			186	193					OCT 2010	2010	Selected forestry officials in each of the 13 western states were surveyed in 2005 concerning their opinions on the public and private financial incentive programs available to nonindustrial private forest owners in their state. The officials were asked to name and describe the programs and to assess forest owners' awareness of each one, its appeal among owners aware of it, its effectiveness in encouraging sustainable forestry and enabling owners to meet their objectives, and the percent of program practices that remain in place and enrolled acres that remain in forest over time. They also were asked to suggest ways to improve the programs. The FSP, FLEP, and FLP were among the top-rated federal programs. Programs sponsored by states and private organizations tended to be more narrowly targeted than federal programs and scored well for specific attributes of sustainability.

Summers, Adam/A-9060-2013	Summers, Adam/0000-0003-1930-9748			A soft origin for a forceful bite: motor patterns of the feeding musculature in Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa								ZOOLOGY				113	5			259	268		10.1016/j.zool.2010.02.001			OCT 2010	2010	Despite lacking jaws and substantial rigid support for feeding muscles, hagfishes can forcefully grasp and ingest chunks of flesh from their prey. When feeding, bilaterally folding dental plates protrude from the mouth, then forcefully retract. This cyclic protraction and retraction occurs in the anterior region of the hagfish feeding apparatus (HFA) and involves both a cartilaginous skeleton and a complex array of muscles that act as a hydrostat. We recorded motor patterns from the largest muscles in the HFA in six specimens of Myxine glutinosa: the deep protractor muscle (DPM), clavatus muscle (CM), perpendicularis muscle (PM), and tubulatus muscle (TM). Individuals normally used four gape cycles to ingest food and four gape cycles to intraorally transport food. We measured burst duration from each muscle and the onsets of kinematic events and the onsets of CM, PM, and TM bursts relative to the onset of the DPM. The DPM fired during protraction, while the CM, PM and TM fired during retraction. Our study corroborates our anatomical predictions about DPM and CM function. Activation of the circumferentially and vertically oriented fibers of the TM and PM stiffens the origin of the CM, allowing it to forcefully retract the dental plates. The progressive decrease in retractor muscle activity during gape cycles following ingestion suggests a reliance on passive properties of the musculoskeletal system for retraction.

Before and after fluorination, the thin films have been characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy. Rutherford Backscattering spectroscopy, Fourier Transformed InfraRed and Raman spectroscopies.

Emphasis is on upper mesosphere (87 km) hydroxyl (OH) temperatures at Wuppertal (51 degrees N, 7 degrees E) that agree favorably with satellite-borne observations from Sounding of the Atmosphere Using Broadband Emission Radiometry and a twin OH instrument at Hohenpeissenberg (48 degrees N, 11 degrees E) that is operational since 2003. The two twin stations yield a combined data set with 80% time coverage suitable for high time resolution analyses. Annual mean temperatures at Wuppertal show a long-term trend of -0.23 K/yr and a solar flux sensitivity of 0.035 K/solar flux unit. Trend analysis of monthly mean temperatures yields substantial variations from one month to another, between 0 and -0.6 K/yr, hence questioning the value of seasonal mean trends. The OH temperatures have a well-known characteristic form of seasonal variation. This form changes during the 21 years of observation. The changes are compared to modifications of the summer length in the stratosphere and are interpreted as dynamics/circulation changes extending to the uppermost parts of the middle atmosphere.									30	0	0	0	0	30			2169-897X			WOS:000282507000002

Owing to the diversity of peptide and protein sequences which have been shown to aggregate into ordered structures, the ability to self-assemble is now recognized as an inherent feature of the polypeptide backbone. It is therefore of utmost importance to elucidate the rules governing the self-assembly process. De nova designed oligopeptides, based on sequences of alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues and containing complementary charge distributions, have shown the potential to self-assemble into hydrogels rich in beta-sheet secondary structure. Here we present and characterize the unexpected self-assembly and hydrogel formation of AK-16, an alanine-rich oligopeptide, whose sequence does not abide by typical rules which allow for peptide self-organization. AK-16 spontaneously forms soluble, thermodynamically unstable/beta-sheet-rich aggregates, which can be stabilized by salt addition to yield a self-supporting macroscopic hydrogel. The AK-16 hydrogel exhibits the ability to encapsulate and slowly release a model protein. This one-charge-type system represents a novel class of self-assembling oligopeptides, in which the initial conformational instability can be exploited to tune the viscosity and physicochemical properties of the resultant hydrogel. This study provides insight for the future de nova design of self-assembling oligopeptides.									12	1	0	2	0	13			0024-9297			WOS:000281883000051

Paludicola				8	1			37	48					27 September 2010	2010	Three fossil holocephalian tooth plates have been recovered in Kingstree, Williamsburg County, South Carolina. All of the fossils were collected from a lag deposit containing a temporally mixed vertebrate assemblage. Two specimens, an incomplete left mandibular tooth plate and an incomplete left palatine tooth plate, are Edaphodon and compare favorably to E. mirificus. The third specimen is an incomplete and highly abraded right mandibular tooth plate from a very young individual that is questionably referred to Edaphodon. The tooth plates were associated with Cretaceous shark and dinosaur teeth, Paleocene shark and crocodilian teeth and turtle bones, and Plio-Pleistocene shark teeth and terrestrial mammal remains. The source of the Cretaceous fossils is arguably from Maastrichtian (late Cretaceous) strata (i.e., Peedee or Steel Creek formations), whereas Paleocene fossils are likely derived from the Danian (lower Paleocene) Rhems Formation. These fossils were probably concentrated together during Plio-Pleistocene sea level highstand, at which time the younger vertebrate material was deposited.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1091-0263			ZOOREC:ZOOR14702013829

Robustness to thermal effects is guaranteed only when T <<Delta 2/epsilon F similar to 0.1 mK, which is a very severe experimental constraint. Here we show that when s-wave superconductivity is proximity-induced on the surface of a topological insulator or a spin-orbit-coupled semiconductor, as has been recently suggested, the minigaps of the resultant non-Abelian states can be orders of magnitude larger than in a chiral p-wave superconductor. Specifically, for interfaces with sufficient barrier transparencies, the minigap can be as high as similar to Delta >>Delta(2)/epsilon(F), where Delta is the bulk gap of the s-wave superconductor.									80	1	0	1	0	80			1098-0121			WOS:000282167600002

The total reaction volume was 60 mu L, saving the cost. The assay was based on a HPLC separation and quantification of the synthetic substrate hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine and its hydrolyzed product-hippuric acid; the separation was performed on a C(18) column eluted by a mobile phase of acetonitrile/water(0.5% TFA) at a volume ratio of 25:75. At a signal to noise ratio(S//V) of 10, the detective limit of the quantitation of hippuric acid was (0.4600+/-0.0097) mu mol/L. The standard curve shows a linear response with a slope of 49488 and a correlation coefficient of 0.9995. The assay was adequate for the study of ACE inhibition by Captopril and peptides derived from food protein, and showed a very good correlation with the previous methods.									5	1	0	4	0	5			1005-9040			WOS:000283618500009

Toward a photoconducting semiconductor RF optical fiber antenna array								APPLIED OPTICS				49	27			5163	5168		10.1364/AO.49.005163			SEP 20 2010	2010	Recently, optical fibers comprising a crystalline semiconductor core in a silica cladding have been successfully drawn by a conventional drawing process. These fibers are expected to exhibit a photoconductive response when illuminated by photons more energetic than the band gap of the core. In the photoconducting state, such a fiber can be expected to support driven RF currents so as to function as an antenna element, much as a plasma antenna. In this paper, we report the first device-related results on a crystalline semiconductor core optical fiber potentially useful in a photoconducting optical fiber antenna array; namely, optically induced changes to the electrical conductivity of a glass-clad germanium-core optical fiber. Since DC photoconduction measurements were masked by a photovoltaic effect, RF measurements at 5 MHz were used to determine the magnitude of the induced photoconductive effect. The observed photoconductivity, though not large in the present experiment, was comparable to that measured for the bulk crystals from which the fibers were drawn. The absorbed pumping light generated photo-carriers, thereby transforming the core from a dielectric material to a conductor. This technology could thus enable a class of transient antenna elements useful in low observable and reconfigurable antenna array applications.

Recently, it has been found that acellular tissue scaffolds provide natural ultrastructural, mechanical, and compositional cues for recellularization and tissue remodeling. We thus assess the potential of decellularized porcine myocardium as a scaffold for thick cardiac patch tissue engineering. Myocardial sections with 2-mm thickness were decellularized using 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and then reseeded with differentiated bone marrow mononuclear cells. We found that thorough decellularization could be achieved after 2.5 weeks of treatment. Reseeded cells were found to infiltrate and proliferate in the tissue constructs. Immunohistological staining studies showed that the reseeded cells maintained cardiomyocyte-like phenotype and possible endothelialization was found in locations close to vasculature channels, indicating angiogenesis potential. Both biaxial and uniaxial mechanical testing showed a stiffer mechanical response of the acellular myocardial scaffolds; however, tissue extensibility and tensile modulus were found to recover in the constructs along with the culture time, as expected from increased cellular content. The cardiac patch that we envision for clinical application will benefit from the natural architecture of myocardial extracellular matrix, which has the potential to promote stem cell differentiation, cardiac regeneration, and angiogenesis.

In mass rearing S. tsugae, accurate estimation of egg numbers is important because larvae are cannibalistic, especially at higher densities. To determine the most accurate means of estimating egg production, three brands of gauze were compared as oviposition substrates. Curad (R) gauze provided the most accurate estimate of egg production, and was the most cost effective brand. When eggs were collected from oviposition jars, similar adult yields of S. tsugae occurred between rearing cages infested with 1,650 eggs from gauze compared to eggs on the twigs from within these jars. Additionally, orientation of oviposition jars impacted S. tsugae egg production as significantly more eggs were produced in horizontally oriented oviposition jars.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1536-2442			WOS:000282593400001	21070172

The miktoarms present a branched arrangement in the soluble block in the fashion of PI-(PI)2, where two PI blocks are connected by a common end point to a linear PS-PI diblock. It is found that these copolymers self-assemble into spherical micelles having cores composed of the insoluble PS blocks and coronas of the well-solvated PI-(PI)(2) blocks. Micelles formed from the branched polymer amphiphiles are more compact, having smaller sizes than the micelles formed from a linear PS-PI diblock copolymer of similar molecular weight and composition. As the concentration is decreased, the micelles with large aggregation numbers remain stable, only showing changes in the aggregation number. The hydrodynamic sizes and aggregation numbers determined from the micelles formed from miktoarm copolymers differ from theoretical predictions for spherical micelles made of the equivalent linear amphiphilic diblock copolymers. These differences may arise from the arrangements of the branched blocks inside the micellar corona.									9	1	0	0	0	9			0024-9297	1520-5835		WOS:000281474500050

I. COMPARING PRE-SWIFT AND SWIFT-ERA LONG/SOFT (TYPE II) GRB OPTICAL AFTERGLOWS								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				720	2			1513	1558		10.1088/0004-637X/720/2/1513			SEP 10 2010	2010	We have gathered optical photometry data from the literature on a large sample of Swift-era gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows including GRBs up to 2009 September, for a total of 76 GRBs, and present an additional three pre-Swift GRBs not included in an earlier sample. Furthermore, we publish 840 additional new photometry data points on a total of 42 GRB afterglows, including large data sets for GRBs 050319, 050408, 050802, 050820A, 050922C, 060418, 080413A, and 080810. We analyzed the light curves of all GRBs in the sample and derived spectral energy distributions for the sample with the best data quality, allowing us to estimate the host-galaxy extinction. We transformed the afterglow light curves into an extinction-corrected z = 1 system and compared their luminosities with a sample of pre-Swift afterglows. The results of a former study, which showed that GRB afterglows clustered and exhibited a bimodal distribution in luminosity space, are weakened by the larger sample. We found that the luminosity distribution of the two afterglow samples (Swift-era and pre-Swift) is very similar, and that a subsample for which we were not able to estimate the extinction, which is fainter than the main sample, can be explained by assuming a moderate amount of line-of-sight host extinction. We derived bolometric isotropic energies for all GRBs in our sample, and found only a tentative correlation between the prompt energy release and the optical afterglow luminosity at 1 day after the GRB in the z = 1 system. A comparative study of the optical luminosities of GRB afterglows with echelle spectra (which show a high number of foreground absorbing systems) and those without, reveals no indication that the former are statistically significantly more luminous. Furthermore, we propose the existence of an upper ceiling on afterglow luminosities and study the luminosity distribution at early times, which was not accessible before the advent of the Swift satellite. Most GRBs feature afterglows that are dominated by the forward shock from early times on. Finally, we present the first indications of a class of long GRBs, which form a bridge between the typical high-luminosity, high-redshift events and nearby low-luminosity events (which are also associated with spectroscopic supernovae) in terms of energetics and observed redshift distribution, indicating a continuous distribution overall.									144	1	1	1	0	146			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000281624300049

Model compounds are characterized with respect to proton conductivity, viscosity, proton, and anion (conjugate base) self-diffusion coefficients, and Hammett acidity. The highest conductivities, and also the highest viscosities, are observed for the phosphonic and phosphinic acid model compounds. Arrhenius analysis of conductivity and viscosity for these two acids reveals much lower activation energies for ion transport than for viscous flow. Additionally, the proton self-diffusion coefficients are much higher than the conjugate-base self-diffusion coefficients for these two acids. Taken together, these data suggest that anhydrous proton transport in the phosphonic and phosphinic acid model compounds occurs primarily by a structure-diffusion, hopping-based mechanism rather than a vehicle mechanism. Further analysis of ionic conductivity and ion self-diffusion rates by using the Nernst-Einstein equation reveals that the phosphonic and phosphinic acid model compounds are relatively highly dissociated even under anhydrous conditions. In contrast, sulfonic and carboxylic acid-based systems exhibit relatively low degrees of dissociation under anhydrous conditions. These findings suggest that fluoroalkyl phosphonic and phosphinic acids are good candidates for further development as anhydrous, high-temperature proton conductors.									17	2	0	0	0	17			1439-4235			WOS:000282539100022	20602408

The silicon cantilevers were sequentially coated with chromium and silicon dioxide, and the silicon dioxide was selectively etched at the tip apex using focused-electron-beam-induced etching (FEBIE) with XeF2. The chromium layer acted not only as the conductive path from the tip, but also as an etch-resistant layer. This insulated scanning probe fabrication process is compatible with any commercial AFM tip and can be used to easily tailor the scanning probe tip properties because FEBIE does not require lithography. The suitability of the fabricated probes is demonstrated by imaging of a standard topographical calibration grid as well as piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and electrical measurements in ambient and liquid environments.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000280878500002	20702930

Membranes with the same (symmetric) and different (asymmetric) compositions in their inner and outer leaflets were deposited at surface pressures of 20, 30, and 40 mN/m at the solid-liquid interface. Using neutron reflectometry, membranes of various global molar ratios (defined as the sum of the molar ratios of the inner and outer leaflets), were characterized before and after beta-CD was added to the subphase. The structure of bilayers with global molar ratios at or above the stable complexation ratio was unchanged by beta-CD, indicating that beta-CD is unable to remove sphingomyelin or complexed Chol. However, beta-CD removed all uncomplexed Chol from bilayers composed of global molar ratios below the stable complexation ratio. The removal of Chol by beta-CD was independent of the initial structure of the membranes as deposited, suggesting that asymmetric membranes homogenize by the exchange of molecules between leaflets. The interaction of beta-CD with the aforementioned membranes was independent of the deposition surface pressure except for a symmetric 50:50 membrane deposited at 40 mN/m. The scattering from 50:50 bilayers with higher packing densities (deposited at 40 mN/m) was unaffected by beta-CD, suggesting that the removal of Chol can depend on both the composition and packing density of the membrane.									15	0	0	9	0	15			0006-3495			WOS:000281721500017	20816059

Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were isolated from cotton and introduced into calcium alginate fibers with the goal of improving their strength and modulus. The isolated CNCs are elongated nanoparticles of crystalline cellulose with an average length of 130 nm with a standard deviation (s)of 63 nm, an average width of 20.4 nm (s = 7.8 nm), and an average height of 6.8 nm (s = 3.3 urn). The CNCs were mixed with an aqueous sodium alginate dope solution and wet spun into a CaCl(2) bath to form fibers. It was found that if the apparent jet stretch (ratio of the fiber draw velocity to extrusion velocity) is kept constant, addition of the nanocrystals reduces the tensile strength and modulus of the material; however, a small concentration of CNCs in the dope solution increases the tensile energy to break and enables an increase in the fiber spinning apparent jet stretch ratio by nearly 2-fold at up to 25% CNCs load; the maximum ratio of 4.6 is observed at 25 wt % CNC loading as compared to a maximum of 2.4 for the native alginate. Mechanical testing showed a 38% increase in tenacity and a 123% increase in tensile modulus with 10 wt % CNCs loading and an apparent jet stretch of 4.2. The data suggest that alignment of the nanocrystals in the composites is a key factor influencing the mechanical properties. CNCs have potential to become it biocompatible, renewable, and cost-effective solution to reinforce alginate fibers.									32	0	0	10	1	32			0743-7463			WOS:000281354000076	20712357

Improved calculation of vibrational mode lifetimes in anharmonic solids - Part II: Numerical results								COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE				49	3			445	449		10.1016/j.commatsci.2010.04.039			SEP 2010	2010	In a two-part publication, we propose and analyze a formal foundation for practical calculations of vibrational mode lifetimes in solids. The approach is based on a recursion method analysis of the Liouvillian. In the first part, we derived the lifetime of vibrational modes in terms of moments of the power spectrum of the Liouvillian as projected onto the relevant subspace of phase space. In practical terms, the moments are evaluated as ensemble averages of well-defined operators, meaning that the entire calculation is to be done with Monte Carlo. In this second part, we present a numerical analysis of a simple anharmonic model of lattice vibrations which exhibits two regimes of behavior, at low temperature and at high temperature. Our results show that, for this simple model, the mode lifetime as a function of temperature and wavevector can be simply approximated as a function of the shift in frequency from the harmonic limit. We next compare these calculations, obtained using both Monte Carlo and computationally intensive molecular dynamics, with those using the lowest order moment formalism from the Part I. We show that, in the high temperature regime, the lowest order approximation gives a reliable approximation to the calculated lifetimes. The results also show that extension to at least fourth moment is required to obtain reliable results over a full range of temperatures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, when nonprofits use actors in lieu of real victims in their PSA messages, real financial and reputational loss to the nonprofit may occur. In this study, the authors develop and test a model of the antecedents to perceived social responsibility of and people's subsequent intent to donate to nonprofits that employ PSAs. They also investigate the efficacy of using actor portrayal labels when composites of real victims rather than actual victims are portrayed in the PSAs. The results confirm that viewers experience a stronger emotional connection when the PSA uses real victims, along with greater perceptions of the nonprofit's social responsibility and greater subsequent intent to donate to the nonprofit. The authors propose that self-regulation may help mitigate negative reactions to PSA messages that employ actors rather than real victims in the PSAs.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0743-9156			WOS:000284182800006

To read it as both would be to reconcile the literary and philosophical aspects of Rousseau's thought; however, as the "or" that divides its title suggests, this work confronts readers with the potential irreconcilability of literary and philosophical discourses. The difficulty of reconciling these, competing discourses, and consequently the challenge of reading Emile, is most notable at the moment when Emile, himself, must come to read the only book he will ever need to read, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe. This one book, suggests Rousseau, will teach him to read all others, but within Emile the reader discovers the possibility that one only ever learns to read as someone other than oneself.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0840-6286			WOS:000283890900005

Labor unions and safety climate: Perceived union safety values and retail employee safety outcomes								ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION				42	5	SI		1477	1487		10.1016/j.aap.2009.11.003			SEP 2010	2010	Although trade unions have long been recognized as a critical advocate for employee safety and health, safety climate research has not paid much attention to the role unions play in workplace safety. We proposed a multiple constituency model of workplace safety which focused on three central safety stake-holders: top management, ones' immediate supervisor, and the labor union. Safety climate research focuses on management and supervisors as key stakeholders, but has not considered whether employee perceptions about the priority their union places on safety contributes contribute to safety outcomes. We addressed this gap in the literature by investigating unionized retail employee (N = 535) perceptions about the extent to which their top management, immediate supervisors, and union valued safety. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that perceived union safety values could be distinguished from measures of safety training, workplace hazards, top management safety values, and supervisor values. Structural equation analyses indicated that union safety values influenced safety outcomes through its association with higher safety motivation, showing a similar effect as that of supervisor safety values. These findings highlight the need for further attention to union-focused measures related to workplace safety as well as further study of retail employees in general. We discuss the practical implications of our findings and identify several directions for future safety research. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of cardiac overexpression of type 6 adenylyl cyclase affects on the response to chronic pressure overload. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 299: H707-H712, 2010. First published June 18, 2010; doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00148.2010.-Adenylyl cyclase (AC) type 5 (AC5) and AC type 6 (AC6) are the two major AC isoforms in the heart. Cardiac overexpression of AC6 has been shown to be protective in response to several interventions. In this investigation, we examined the effects of chronic pressure overload in AC6 transgenic (TG) mice. In the absence of any stress, AC6 TG mice exhibited enhanced contractile function compared with their wild-type (WT) littermates, i.e., increased (P < 0.05) left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) (75 +/- 0.9 vs. 71 +/- 0.5%) and LV dP/dt (7,850 +/- 526 vs. 6,374 +/- 315 mmHg/s). Forskolin (25 mu g.kg(-1).min(-1) for 5 min) increased LVEF more (P < 0.05) in AC6 TG mice (14.8 +/- 1.0%) than in WT mice (7.7 +/- 1.0%). Also, isoproterenol (0.04 mu g.kg(-1).min(-1) for 5 min) increased LVEF more (P < 0.05) in AC6 TG mice (18.0 +/- 1.2%) than in WT mice (11.6 +/- 2.1%). Pressure overload, induced by 4 wk of transverse aortic constriction (TAC), increased the LV weight-to-body weight ratio and myocyte cross-sectional area similarly in both groups, but reduced LVEF more in AC6 TG mice (22%) compared with WT mice (9%), despite the higher starting level of LVEF in AC6 TG mice. LV systolic wall stress increased more in AC6 TG mice than in WT mice, which could be responsible for the reduced LVEF in AC6 TG mice with chronic pressure overload. In addition, LV dP/dt was no longer elevated in AC6 TG mice after TAC compared with WT mice. LV end-diastolic diameter was also greater (P < 0.05) in AC6 TG mice (3.8 +/- 0.07 mm) than in WT mice (3.6 +/- 0.05 mm) after TAC. Thus, in contrast to other interventions previously reported to be salutary with cardiac AC6 overpression, the response to chronic pressure overload was not; actually, AC6 TG mice fared worse than WT mice. The mechanism may be due to the increased LV systolic wall stress in AC6 TG mice with chronic pressure overload.									12	0	0	12	0	12			0363-6135	1522-1539		WOS:000281537400016	20562336

(Hymenoptera: Apidae). suffer simultaneously from multiple stress factors, raising concern that multiple stressors could be interacting to compound bee stress in an additive or synergistic fashion. We tested two null hypotheses 1) Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman (Acari. Varroidae) (=varroa) and Aethina tumida Murray (Coleoptera. Nitidulidae) do not interact such that the number of one affects the number or density of the other and 2) bee damage from one does not change in response to changing levels of the other. In a split-split plot design replicated in 2 yr and two states, experimental apiaries were established and each manipulated to achieve one of five average SE colony adult A tumida populations: 0; 285 +/- 6, 721 +/- 5, 1,544 +/- 14, or 3,175 +/- 90 Within each apiary, the population of varroa mites in each colony was manipulated to achieve one of three average SE colony mite populations 763 +/- 121, 1,111 +/- 155; or 1,856 +/- 300. On a one-way basis, there was a predictable increase in measures of bee morbidity with increasing densities of each pest Colony varroa mite levels decreased as apiary-wide A. tumida levels increased In contrast, colony levels of the honey bee mite, Acarapis woodi (Rennie) (Acari. Tarsonemidae), increased as colony varroa levels increased Concerning measures of bee morbidity, varroa and A tumida did not interact such that damage by one was affected by changing levels of the other A treatment threshold established for varroa before the arrival of A tumida has not changed during the years since A. tumida has become established in the region.									7	0	0	6	0	7			0013-8746			WOS:000281655300003

Probing the evolving massive star population in Orion with kinematic and radioactive tracers								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				520						A51	10.1051/0004-6361/201014408			SEP-OCT 2010	2010	Context. Orion is the nearest star-forming region to host a significant number of young and massive stars. The energy injected by these OB stars is thought to have created the Eridanus superbubble. Because of its proximity, Orion is a prime target for a detailed investigation of the interaction between massive stars and their environment.Aims. We study the massive star population of Orion and its feedback in terms of energy and mass, in order to compare the current knowledge of massive stars with kinematic and radioactive tracers in the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM).Methods. We assembled a census of the most massive stars in Orion, then used stellar isochrones to estimate their masses and ages, and used these results to establish the stellar content of Orion's individual OB associations. From this, our new population synthesis code was utilized to derive the history of the emission of UV radiation and kinetic energy of the material ejected by the massive stars and also to follow the ejection of the long-lived radioactive isotopes Al-26 and Fe-60. To estimate the precision of our method, we compare and contrast three distinct representations of the massive stars. We compared the expected outputs with observations of Al-26 gamma-ray signal and the extent of the Eridanus cavity.Results. We find an integrated kinetic energy emitted by the massive stars of 1.8(-0.4)(+1.5) x 10(52) erg. This number is consistent with the energy thought to be required to create the Eridanus superbubble. We also find good agreement between our model and the observed Al-26 signal, estimating a mass of 5.8(-2.5)(+2.7) x 10(-4) M-circle dot of Al-26 in the Orion region.Conclusions. Our population synthesis approach is demonstrated for the Orion region to reproduce three different kinds of observable outputs from massive stars in a consistent manner: kinetic energy as manifested in ISM excavation, and ionization as manifested in free-free emission, and nucleosynthesis ejecta as manifested in radioactivity gammarays. The good match between our model and the observables does not argue for considerable modifications of mass loss. If clumping effects turn out to be strong, other processes would need to be identified to compensate for their impact on massive-star outputs. Our population synthesis analysis jointly treats kinematic output and the return of radioactive isotopes, which proves a powerful extension of the methodology that constrains feedback from massive stars.									11	0	0	1	0	11			1432-0746			WOS:000283064200054

The spectrum shows prominent Lyman-alpha absorption with N(H I) = 10(21.73 +/- 0.07) cm(-2) and a multitude of metal lines at a common redshift of z = 2.1062 +/- 0.0004, which we associate with the redshift of the gamma-ray burst (GRB). The metallicity derived from S II is log(Z/Z(circle dot)) approximate to -1.9, one of the lowest values ever found in a GRB Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) system. This confirms that the spread of metallicity in GRB-DLAs at z approximate to 2 is at least two orders of magnitude. We argue that this spread in metallicity does not require a similar range in abundances of the GRB progenitors, since the neutral interstellar medium probed by the DLA is expected to be at a significant distance from the explosion site. The hydrogen column density derived from the Swift/XRT afterglow spectrum (assuming log(Z/Z(circle dot)) approximate to -1.9) is approx. approximate to 100 times higher than the N(H I) obtained from the Lyman-alpha absorptions. This suggests either a large column density of ionized gas or a higher metallicity of the circum-burst medium compared to the gas traced by the DLA. We also discuss the afterglow light curve evolution and energetics. The absence of a clear jet-break like steeping until at least 21 days post-burst suggests a beaming-corrected energy release of E(gamma) > 3.5 x 10(52) erg, indicating that GRB 090926A may have been one of the most energetic bursts ever detected.									36	1	0	0	0	36			0004-637X			WOS:000281596000073

Oculomotor measures as predictors of performance during sleep deprivation. Aviat Space Environ Med 2010; 81:833-42.Introduction: Studies have indicated that working under sleep deprivation conditions results in deficits in performance on various tasks. Few studies, however, have attempted to find a measure for predicting performance changes under sleep deprivation conditions. The current study examined whether oculomotor measures could predict changes in performance under non-sleep deprivation and acute short-term sleep deprivation conditions. Methods: Oculomotor measures and performance were examined during five testing sessions in each study. In the non-sleep deprivation study (N = 23) the testing sessions took place during 2 consecutive days. The sleep deprivation study (N = 26) took place in an 18-h sustained operations period during the night of sleep deprivation. Results: Under non-sleep deprivation conditions, pupil diameter significantly predicted performance on grammatical reasoning (B = 0.360) and constriction latency significantly predicted performance on combined tasks (B = 0.182). Under sleep deprivation conditions, diameter, constriction latency, and saccadic velocity significantly predicted performance on a psychomotor vigilance task (B = -21.002, B = -23.126, B = -18.028, respectively). Overall, oculomotor measures better predicted performance changes under sleep deprivation conditions and better predicted performance decrements on vigilance-based tasks than cognitive tasks under acute sleep deprivation conditions. Discussion: The current research suggests saccadic velocity and pupil diameter may be the most useful predictors of performance under sleep deprivation conditions, perhaps because these measures are largely controlled by involuntary neural components that slow during sleep deprivation. These data support research suggesting that saccadic velocity and pupil diameter detect excessive sleepiness and predict performance decrements under sleep deprivation conditions using additional oculomotor measures and a non-sleep deprivation comparison group.									6	2	0	3	0	8			0095-6562			WOS:000281266300003	20824989

Laser-based direct writing, a printing technique first utilized in electronics applications, has been adapted to transfer living cells and other biological materials ( e. g., enzymes, proteins and bioceramics). Many different cell types have been printed using laser-based direct writing, and this technique offers significant improvements when compared to conventional cell patterning techniques. The predominance of work to date has not been in application of the technique, but rather focused on demonstrating the ability of direct writing to pattern living cells, in a spatially precise manner, while maintaining cellular viability. This paper reviews laser-based additive direct-write techniques for cell printing, and the various cell types successfully laser direct-written that have applications in tissue engineering, stem cell and cancer research are highlighted. A particular focus is paid to process dynamics modeling and process-induced cell injury during laser-based cell direct writing.									77	1	0	44	0	78			1758-5082			WOS:000281674000001	20814088

In addition, the calculation of the internal pressure of a system with fixed atoms may be highly inaccurate due to the nonphysical nature of the atomic constraints and difficulties in accurately defining the volume occupied by the unconstrained atoms in the system. The inability to properly set and control pressure can result in substantial problems for the accurate simulation of condensed-phase systems if the behavior of the system (e. g., peptide/protein adsorption) is sensitive to pressure. To address this issue, the authors have developed an approach to accurately determine the internal pressure for a system with constrained atoms. As the first step in this method, a periodically extendable portion of the mobile phase of the constrained system (e. g., the solvent atoms) is used to create a separate unconstrained system for which the pressure can be accurately calculated. This model system is then used to create a pressure calibration plot for an intensive local effective virial parameter for a small volume cross section or "slab" of the system. Using this calibration plot, the pressure of the constrained system can then be determined by calculating the virial parameter for a similarly sized slab of mobile atoms. In this article, the authors present the development of this method and demonstrate its application using the CHARMM molecular simulation program to characterize the adsorption behavior of a peptide in explicit water on a hydrophobic surface whose lattice spacing is maintained with atomic constraints. The free energy of adsorption for this system is shown to be dramatically influenced by pressure, thus emphasizing the importance of properly maintaining the pressure of the system for the accurate simulation of protein-surface interactions.

Antioxidant and Anticancer Properties and Mechanisms of Inorganic Selenium, Oxo-Sulfur, and Oxo-Selenium Compounds								CELL BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS				58	1			1	23		10.1007/s12013-010-9088-x			SEP 2010	2010	Inorganic selenium and oxo-sulfur compounds are widely available in dietary supplements and have been extensively studied for their antioxidant and anticancer properties. Although many in vivo and clinical trials have been conducted using these compounds, their biochemical and chemical mechanisms of efficacy are the focus of much current research. This review discusses the ability of inorganic selenium compounds, such as selenite, and selenate, to prevent damage from reactive oxygen species as well as their ability to promote cell death by reactive oxygen species generation. Oxo-sulfur and selenium compounds, such as allicin, dimethyl sulfone, methionine sulfoxide, and methylselenenic acid also have similar abilities to act as both antioxidants and pro-oxidants, but the mechanisms for these behaviors are distinctly different from those of the inorganic selenium compounds. The antioxidant and pro-oxidant properties of these small-molecule sulfur and selenium compounds are extremely complex and often greatly depend on experimental conditions, which may explain contradictory literature reports of their efficacy.									38	1	0	27	0	39			1085-9195			WOS:000280842900001	20632128

Two percent of patients suspected of having Angelman syndrome have TCF4 mutations								CLINICAL GENETICS				78	3			282	288		10.1111/j.1399-0004.2010.01380.x			SEP 2010	2010	The TCF4 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor which belongs to the family of E-proteins. E-proteins form homo- and heterodimers with other members of the HLH family and bind to the common DNA sequence called E-box. Haploinsufficiency of the TCF4 gene has been found to be associated with the Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS). PTHS is characterized by severe mental retardation, a wide mouth plus other distinctive facial features (fleshy lips, beaked nose, broad nasal bridge) and breathing abnormalities. Because of some phenotypical overlap with Angelman syndrome (AS), it has been suggested that PTHS be considered in its differential diagnosis. To explore this possibility, we screened 86 patients who were suspected of having AS. All the patients were negative for UBE3A testing, and 53 were known to be negative for methylation analysis. We identified two TCF4 mutations in this cohort. The p.S384Tfsx7 mutation lacks the bHLH domain. The p.R582P mutation lies within the bHLH domain in which seven other missense mutations have been reported. Both mutations most likely affect the critical function of the bHLH domain of the TCF4 protein. In summary, we found two TCF4 mutations in 86 patients (2%) suspected to have AS. Screening for mutations in this gene should be considered in patients who present with findings of AS but who have been negative for methylation and UBE3A testing.									23	0	0	20	0	24			0009-9163			WOS:000280629500009	20184619	
J	Xiao, Feipeng; Amirkhanian, Serji N.								Effects of liquid antistrip additives on rheology and moisture susceptibility of water bearing warm mixtures								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				24	9			1649	1655		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2010.02.027			SEP 2010	2010	Warm mix asphalt (WMA) has been gaining increasing popularity in recent years around the world. Rising energy prices, global warming, and more stringent environmental regulations have resulted in an interest in WMA technologies as a mean to decrease the energy consumption and emissions. However, the water absorption and release process caused by water bearing WMA additive (Asphamin) makes the charge re-distribution complex and thus may result in the moisture induced damage of asphalt mixtures. Especially, the liquid antistrip additives (ASAs) blended with the binder and then mixed with aggregate and Asphamin make the issue more complicated. The objective of this study was to investigate and evaluate the rheological properties and moisture susceptibility of the binder and mixture containing ASAs and Asphamin additive. The experimental design for this study included rheological property tests of binders and moisture susceptibility of mixtures. The materials included one binder (PG 64-16), two liquid ASAs and hydrated lime, one water bearing additive, and three aggregate sources. The performed testing included viscosity, performance grade, creep and creep recovery, amplitude sweep, frequency sweep, boiling test, and indirect tensile strength (ITS). The results indicated that the addition of Asphamin can slightly increase the viscosity, failure temperature and G(+)/sin delta values. The mixture containing Asphamin has a lower ITS value than others. Statistical analysis illustrates that there is not significant difference in ITS value between any mixtures containing Asphamin additive and control mixtures. However, significant differences can be found between mixtures containing Asphamin and without any Asphamin additive. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

These acids are contributing a key role during synthesis of antimicrobial drugs. Method: The acids were prepared by condensation of various substituted phenyl acetic acids and aldehydes. o-Piperonal was prepared using 2,3-methylenedioxy benzaldehyde. These phenyl acrylic acids were characterized by using analytical techniques, for example, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, multinuclear NMR (H-1, C-13 NMR), and GC-MS. The structure of crystalline products was also elucidated by X-ray crystallography. Small intermolecular and intrannolecular weaker interactions were also studied by these characterization techniques. Results: The geometry of compounds in solid and solution state has been studied. The presence of weaker interactions in these molecules is also observed which may increase the hydrolysis and lipophilicity and ultimately improve the activity against different microbes. Conclusion: The effect of different groups attached to the main rings and the presence of smaller interaction have been studied. Their factors may enhance the activity of these compounds.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0363-9045	1520-5762		WOS:000282143700008	20384519

Mota, Linda/E-4878-2014				Constitutive Androgen Receptor-Null Mice Are Sensitive to the Toxic Effects of Parathion: Association with Reduced Cytochrome P450-Mediated Parathion Metabolism								DRUG METABOLISM AND DISPOSITION				38	9			1582	1588		10.1124/dmd.110.032961			SEP 2010	2010	Constitutive androgen receptor (CAR) is activated by several chemicals and in turn regulates multiple detoxification genes. Our research demonstrates that parathion is one of the most potent, environmentally relevant CAR activators with an EC(50) of 1.43 mu M. Therefore, animal studies were conducted to determine whether CAR was activated by parathion in vivo. Surprisingly, CAR-null mice, but not wild-type (WT) mice, showed significant parathion-induced toxicity. However, parathion did not induce Cyp2b expression, suggesting that parathion is not a CAR activator in vivo, presumably because of its short half-life. CAR expression is also associated with the expression of several drug-metabolizing cytochromes P450 (P450). CAR-null mice demonstrate lower expression of Cyp2b9, Cyp2b10, Cyp2c29, and Cyp3a11 primarily, but not exclusively in males. Therefore, we incubated microsomes from untreated WT and CAR-null mice with parathion in the presence of esterase inhibitors to determine whether CAR-null mice show perturbed P450-mediated parathion metabolism compared with that in WT mice. The metabolism of parathion to paraoxon and p-nitrophenol (PNP) was reduced in CAR-null mice with male CAR-null mice showing reduced production of both paraoxon and PNP, and female CAR-null mice showing reduced production of only PNP. Overall, the data indicate that CAR-null mice metabolize parathion slower than WT mice. These results provide a potential mechanism for increased sensitivity of individuals with lower CAR activity such as newborns to parathion and potentially other chemicals due to decreased metabolic capacity.									9	1	0	9	0	10			0090-9556			WOS:000281114800029	20573718

This article, combining institutional history and discourse analysis, offers a fresh account of the importance of status in late eighteenth-century French political culture. It unveils the status sensitivity of the merchant judges of Toulouse, both in their changing patterns of recruitment and in their series of annual speeches. It situates them within their local culture and charts their entry into an emerging public sphere. It traces the development of a robust sense of the public importance of commerce to France and the world, as well as the tension between an assertive and a submissive expression of this public role, bred by the monarchy's contradictory emphases upon local corporate privilege and uniform national policy.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0269-1191			WOS:000282256900004

Here we investigate, in silico, the molecular effect of three missense mutations, c.267G>A (p.G56S), c.496T>G (p.V132G), and c.550T>C (p.I150T) in SMS that were clinically identified to cause the disease. Single-point energy calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and pKa calculations revealed the effects of these mutations on SMS's stability, flexibility, and interactions. It was predicted that the catalytic residue, Asp276, should be protonated prior binding the substrates. The pKa calculations indicated the p. I150T mutation causes pKa changes with respect to the wild-type SMS, which involve titratable residues interacting with the S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine (MTA) substrate. The p.I150T missense mutation was also found to decrease the stability of the C-terminal domain and to induce structural changes in the vicinity of the MTA binding site. The other two missense mutations, p.G56S and p.V132G, are away from active site and do not perturb its wild-type properties, but affect the stability of both the monomers and the dimer. Specifically, the p.G56S mutation is predicted to greatly reduce the affinity of monomers to form a dimer, and therefore should have a dramatic effect on SMS function because dimerization is essential for SMS activity.

Often, G is supported by a single F-rational point and the resulting code is called a one-point code. Recently, there has been interest in allowing the divisor G to be more general as this can result in superior codes. In particular, one may obtain a code with better parameters by allowing G to be supported by m distinct F-rational points, where m > 1. In this paper, we demonstrate that a multipoint algebraic geometry code C may be embedded in a one-point code C'. Exploiting this fact, we obtain a minimum distance decoding algorithm for the multipoint code C. This is accomplished via list decoding in the one-point code C'.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0018-9448			WOS:000283072400012

Here, we present the effects of various 3D in vitro stroma compositions (termed "matrices" or "substrates") on the ability of heterotypic cultures of epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells to organize into acinar and tubular structures. Normal murine mammary gland (NMuMG) cells were cultured, either alone or in combination (30:70) with mouse mesenchymal stem cells (D1), in 3D matrices generated by agarose, collagen, and MatrigelA (R) alone or by a combination thereof. After 3-5 d in culture, cell distribution, organization, and the presence of acinus-like and tubule-like structures were determined. The number of acinar structures was significantly higher in cultures grown in combination matrices of agarose with MatrigelA (R) or collagen I when compared with cultures grown in MatrigelA (R) or collagen I alone (p < 0.05). No tubular structures were formed when agarose was included in the matrix, regardless of the combination. In MatrigelA (R), but not in collagen I/MatrigelA (R) microenvironment, the number of tubular structures was significantly increased in NMuMG/D1 coculture when compared with culture of NMuMG cells alone (p < 0.05). By immunohistochemical analysis, NMuMG cells cocultured with D1 cells were shown to form acinar structures with the NMuMG epithelial cells surrounding a lumen composed of dead cells while the D1 cells were mostly peripheral. Immunostaining for laminin indicated the presence of basement membrane when NMuMG cells were grown in MatrigelA (R) alone or cocultured with D1 cells in a combination of MatrigelA (R) and collagen I. These results indicate that the physical and biochemical properties of the matrix and cellular composition alter the organization of the mammary gland.									13	1	0	11	0	13			1071-2690			WOS:000281396600004	20585895

Prior research on ISD politics has contributed mainly through theoretical development and case studies. This has enhanced understanding of relevant concepts, political tactics and conditions facilitating politics. However, there is limited understanding of the different processes through which politics unfold. This paper uses 89 ISD projects to develop a taxonomy of political processes in ISD. The taxonomy includes three distinct processes: Tug of War, wherein multiple parties strive to gain project control; Obstacle Race, which involves efforts to resist and pursue the project; and Empire Building, wherein the project is used as an instrument to enhance political or resource bases. The taxonomy is explained using the non-proponents' view of the project and the balance of power between system's proponents and non-proponents. We also discuss the emergent taxonomy's implications for how politics can be managed and studied.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1350-1917	1365-2575		WOS:000280670500002

A combined approach of self-referencing and Principle Component Thermography for transient, steady, and selective heating scenarios								INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY				53	5			358	362		10.1016/j.infrared.2010.06.004			SEP 2010	2010	Proposed manuscript describes the implementation of a two step processing procedure, composed of the self-referencing and the Principle Component Thermography (PCT). The combined approach enables the processing of thermograms from transient (flash), steady (halogen) and selective (induction) thermal perturbations. Firstly, the research discusses the three basic processing schemes typically applied for thermography; namely mathematical transformation based processing, curve-fitting processing, and direct contrast based calculations. Proposed algorithm utilizes the self-referencing scheme to create a sub-sequence that contains the maximum contrast information and also compute the anomalies' depth values. While, the Principle Component Thermography operates on the sub-sequence frames by rearranging its data content (pixel values) spatially and temporally then it highlights the data variance. The PCT is mainly used as a mathematical mean to enhance the defects' contrast thus enabling its shape and size retrieval. The results show that the proposed combined scheme is effective in processing multiple size defects in sandwich steel structure in real-time (<30 Hz) and with full spatial coverage, without the need for a priori defect-free area.

Collecting data across three separate time periods with 218 pharmaceutical sales teams, our results indicate that empowering leadership improves team planning processes and is moderated by the team's experience. Interestingly, it seems that, as teams gain more experience, they are less likely to engage in effective planning; however, these effects are attenuated as the team becomes more virtual in nature. Our findings have relevance for sales managers and salespeople in terms of leveraging team processes to influence performance as well as in terms of presenting the issues associated with virtual means of interaction.

Previously, a metric for computing information content of functions and flows within function models was proposed. Here, this metric is evolved to include the information contained in the connections between flows and functions in a function model. The first approach is based on uniform unconditional probability of a flow connecting any two functions within the model. The second approach is based on additional knowledge that the functions and flows in a model have limited compatibility, thereby, reducing the choices for origin and destination functions for each flow. This additional knowledge is represented using a new graphical representation supported by syntactic grammar rules. Both approaches are then applied to an example function model. Comparison between the approaches shows that the inclusion of this additional knowledge increases the expressiveness by reducing the uncertainty associated with function models.

Effect of Processing Route on the Microstructure and Thermoelectric Properties of Bismuth Telluride-Based Alloys								JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS				39	9			1909	1913		10.1007/s11664-009-1051-5			SEP 2010	2010	Considerable work has been done to engineer materials with high efficiencies of thermoelectric heat-to-electricity conversion and the mechanical strength necessary to withstand the demands of practical applications. In particular, in the bismuth telluride system, extrusion pressing has been found to be effective for improving the mechanical strength of alloys via grain refinement. We review some of the literature relating to processing approaches for the bismuth telluride system. We also present preliminary data for a series of samples obtained by incorporating C(60) via ball milling and spark plasma sintering into a matrix consisting of a (Bi,Sb)(2)Te(3) alloy, with a focus on the texture of the composites and its relation to thermoelectric transport properties, in comparison to the parent material. The viability of improving the thermoelectric performance of bismuth telluride alloys by the insertion of nanoparticles into a composite is also considered.					28th International Conference on Thermoelectrics/7th European Conference on Thermoelectrics28th International Conference on Thermoelectrics/7th European Conference on Thermoelectrics	JUL 26-30, 2009JUL 26-30, 2009		Freiburg, GERMANYFreiburg, GERMANY	14	0	0	0	0	14			0361-5235			WOS:000281393000099		
J	Hooper, Crystal; Craig, Janet; Janvrin, David R.; Wetsel, Margaret A.; Reimels, Elaine								COMPASSION SATISFACTION, BURNOUT, AND COMPASSION FATIGUE AMONG EMERGENCY NURSES COMPARED WITH NURSES IN OTHER SELECTED INPATIENT SPECIALTIES								JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY NURSING				36	5	SI		420	427		10.1016/j.jen.2009.11.027			SEP 2010	2010	Introduction: Today the proportion of acute patients entering the health care system through emergency departments continues to grow, the number of uninsured patients relying primarily on treatment in the emergency department is increasing, and patients' average acuities are rising. At the same time, support resources are constrained, while reimbursement and reputation depends increasingly on publicly available measures of patient satisfaction. It is important to understand the potential effect of these pressures on direct care staff. This study explores the prevalence of compassion satisfaction, burnout, and compassion fatigue among emergency nurses and nurses in other selected inpatient specialties.Methods: Emergency nurses and nurses from 3 other specialty units self-selected participation in a cross-sectional survey. Participants completed a sociodemographic profile and the Professional Quality of Life: Compassion Satisfaction and Fatigue Subscales, R-IV. Scale scores were summed for compassion satisfaction, burnout, and compassion fatigue for emergency nurses and compared with those of nurses in other specialties.Results: Approximately 82% of emergency nurses had moderate to high levels of burnout, and nearly 86% had moderate to high levels of compassion fatigue. Differences between emergency nurses and those working in 3 other specialty areas, that is, oncology, nephrology, and intensive care, on the subscales for compassion satisfaction, burnout, or compassion fatigue did not reach the level of statistical significance. However, the scores of emergency nurses evidenced a risk for less compassion satisfaction, while intensive care nurses demonstrated a higher risk for burnout and oncology nurses reflected a risk for higher compassion fatigue.Discussion: ED nurse managers, along with other nurse leaders, are faced with the competing demands of managing the satisfaction of patients, recruitment and retention of experienced nurses, and provision of quality and safe care customized to patients' needs and preferences. Understanding the concepts of compassion satisfaction, burnout, and compassion fatigue, recognizing the signs and symptoms, and identifying best practice interventions, will help nurses maintain caring attitudes with patients and contribute to patient satisfaction.									81	7	0	6	3	89			0099-1767			WOS:000282399200007	20837210

Film properties were characterized by radical scavenging activity and thermal, physical, and gas barrier properties. Final resin compounding and pelletization was achieved by a twin screw extruder and a pelletizator to permit the homogenization of all resin components prior to film casting. Three different PLA films were fabricated for this study: pure PLA film, PLA film with BHT and PEG 400 (BP-PLA film), PIA film with alpha-tocopherol, BHT, and PEG 400 (ABP-PLA film). The addition of PEG 400 into the pure PLA film decreased the glass transition temperature (T(g)) of the film. The BP-PLA and ABP-PLA film had around 51 degrees C of T(g) while pure PLA film had 66 degrees C. Due to the decreased T(g) of both the BP-PLA and ABP-PLA film, both films had an increased elongation at break (%E). The addition of plasticizer into the pure PIA film also caused increased water vapor permeability (WVP) and decreased oxygen permeability (OP). The ABP-PLA film had highest DPPH radical scavenging activity, 90%, while pure PLA and BP-PLA film had only 0 and 14%, respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Salmonella, and Listeria monocytogenes was compared with that of non heat-shocked (control) strains in finished dairy compost. A three-strain mixture of each pathogen was heat shocked at 47.5 degrees C for 1 It and inoculated into the compost at a final concentration of 10(7) CFU/g The inoculated compost was placed inside an environmental chamber set at 50, 55, or 60 degrees C with humidity at ca. 70%. The heat-shocked E (coli O157.H7, Salmonella. and L monocytogenes survived better (P < 0 05) at 50 degrees C, with reductions of 2 7. 3.2, and 3 9 log CFU/g within 4 h compared with reductions of 3 6. 4 5. and 5 1 log CFU/g. respectively, in control cultures The heat-shocked cultures of E colt O157.H7. Salmonella. and L monocytogenes had 1 2-. 1.9-. and 2 3-log reductions, respectively, within 1 h at 55 degrees C, whereas the corresponding control cultures had 4-, 5 6-, and 4.8-log reductions, respectively. At 60 degrees C, a rapid population reduction was observed during the come-up time of 14 min in control cultures of E colt O157 H7, Salmonella, and L monocytogenes with 4 9-, 4 8-. and 2.3-log reductions, respectively, compared with 2 6-, 2.4-. 1 7-log reductions, respectively, in heat-shocked cultures. L. monocytogenes,genes survival curves for all three temperatures had extensive tailing, The double Wetbull distribution model was a good fit for the survival curves of pathogens, with differences in the shape parameter of heat-shocked and control cultures.

An Agenda That Sets the Frames: Gender, Language, and NBC's Americanized Olympic Telecast								JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY				29	3			363	385		10.1177/0261927X10368831			SEP 2010	2010	This study used theories of agenda setting and framing to examine NBC's Americanized telecast in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Five sports (gymnastics, diving, swimming, track and field, and beach volleyball) received more than 90% of the prime-time coverage, which set an agenda about which sports were most relevant for Americans to watch. The limited scope within NBC's televised agenda, in turn, facilitated the gendered framing of Olympians through sport commentator accounts. Gendered differences were statistically present in only four sports; diving had no significant differences, whereas beach volleyball contained the most differences. Implications and directions for future research are explored.									13	0	0	0	0	13			0261-927X			WOS:000280611600007

The mammary microenvironment is a defined location that encompasses mammary somatic stem cells, neighboring signaling cells, the basement membrane and extracellular matrix, mammary fibroblasts as well as the intercellular signals produced and received by these cells. These dynamic signals take numerous forms including growth factors, steroids, cell-cell or cell-basement membrane physical interactions. Cellular growth and differentiation of the mammary gland throughout the developmental stages are regulated by changes in these signals and interactions. The purpose of this review is to summarize current information and research regarding the role of the mammary microenvironment during normal glandular development.									9	0	1	6	0	10			1083-3021			WOS:000281973100003	20824492

Using bank-level data from 13 European countries, 1998 to 2004, we find evidence of positive effects of "equity-friendly" market features on bank capitalization and positive effects of both "equity-friendly" and "credit-friendly" market features on loan growth. The findings are strongest in small banks and in banks with cooperative charters. Our results suggest that ongoing and prospective integration of European banking markets is mitigated by relatively static features of the equity and credit markets on which banks rely.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-2879	1538-4616		WOS:000281113100004

The effect of an ambidextrous supply chain strategy on combinative competitive capabilities and business performance								JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT				28	5			415	429		10.1016/j.jom.2009.12.002			SEP 2010	2010	This study investigates the influence of an ambidextrous supply chain strategy on manufacturers' combinative competitive capabilities - the ability to excel simultaneously on competitive capabilities of quality, delivery, flexibility, and cost - and, in turn, on business performance. Drawing upon March's (1991) notions of exploration and exploitation, an ambidextrous supply chain strategy is conceptualized as a simultaneous pursuit of both explorative and exploitative supply chain practices. We operationalize this concept as a second-order latent construct that captures the co-variation between exploration and exploitation within the context of a manufacturer's supply chain management strategy. Using survey-based data gathered from 174 U.S. manufacturers, we find that an ambidextrous supply chain strategy coincides with combinative competitive capabilities and business performance. Our empirical finding contradicts conventional wisdom that argues for tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation. Instead, our empirical results are in line with an emerging complementarity view advocating that supply chain managers build practices to gain operational efficiency while simultaneously searching for opportunities to gain operational advantages. In addition, we provide insights regarding the role of combinative capabilities in mediating the relationship between an ambidextrous supply chain strategy and business performance.

Since measurement of the conductivity of Nation in a catalyst layer is problematic, being able to predict this conductivity for various formulations and fuel cell conditions would be advantageous. In this study, the same methodology as before was used to examine the proton availabilities of supported Nation (Nation on carbon and on Pt/C), as exists in the catalyst layer used in a PEMFC, during impurity exposure (e.g., NH3) as a means for prediction of its conductivity. It was found that the effect of NH3 exposure on the proton composition (y(H)(+).) of supported Nation was similar to that of N-211 under the same conditions. Determined values of y(H)(+). were then used to estimate the effective conductivity of an ammonium-poisoned cathode layer using the correlation developed and the agglomerate model. The predicted conductivities were matched with the results available in the literature. This technique would be useful for the optimization of catalyst design and for fuel cell simulation, since it provides many benefits over conventional performance test procedures.

Strictly comparable factor analyses show that its nation-based and place-based variants are observable across world regions. Results indicate that, from 1995 to 2003 among the regions analyzed, place-based localism is declining everywhere. This finding suggests that globalization's effects on personal lives are consequential in terms of decreasing people's attachments to their traditional locales. From 1995 to 2003 nation-based localism has been increasing in most world regions. This finding suggests that nation-based localism - often under the guise of revamped nationalism - is a reaction to globalization's effects on personal lives. But unlike the citizens of other advanced industrialized countries, Europeans have been reducing their own attachment to national societies.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1440-7833	1741-2978		WOS:000281352900004

The results showed that the peak negative pressure coefficients in the high corner regions of monosloped roof buildings are nearly equal to the high corner peak negative pressure coefficients on the windward span (Span A) of the sawtooth roof building, and as expected, low corner zone peak negative pressure coefficients on sawtooth roofs are greater (approximately 150%) than on monosloped roofs. The peak negative coefficients were in general agreement with the earlier wind tunnel study used to develop American wind load design standards, and they suggested that the Australian wind design standard may underestimate the peak loads for moderately sloped (around 20 degrees) sawtooth roofs. Preliminary analyses of the data suggest that current ASCE 7 wind design provisions for monosloped roof buildings may underestimate the high corner design wind pressure. However, this may be offset by a more rapid decrease in area-averaged peak pressure coefficients with increasing tributary areas than was previously observed in the earlier studies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0733-9445			WOS:000280952500013

Evaluation of Reclaimed Polyethylene-Modified Asphalt Pavements								JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION				38	5			541	548		10.1520/JTE102418			SEP 2010	2010	Every year several million tons of low-density polyethylene (PE) carry bags are produced as waste in India. PE is not readily biodegradable and will persist in the environment in a more or less unchanged state for a considerable period of time. Also environmental problems are created due to dumping and also due to limited alternatives for recycling. Utilization of reclaimed PE is of great significance to developed/developing countries particularly for reduction in environmental pollution created due to dumping of PE bags. Since highways require huge amounts of construction materials, incorporation of only a small portion of recycled material will dispose of large quantity of PE bags. In the year 2002, conventional hot mix asphalt (HMA) (control) and PE-modified HMA (PEHMA) test sections were constructed along Outer Ring Road connecting National Highway-4 and Bangalore City. The performances of the control HMA and the PEHMA mixtures were evaluated periodically over a period of 5 years. The control HMA and PEHMA were subjected to a laboratory testing program that included tests to evaluate creep, indirect tensile strength, tensile strength ratio, resilient modulus (M-R), gyratory properties, voids in total mixture, and bulk densities. Test results indicated that the PEHMA mixtures had lower moisture susceptibility, higher tensile strength, and resilient modulus. The gyratory properties and creep tests indicate that the PEHMA mixtures are more resistant to rutting. In-place performance was evaluated by pavement deflection and unevenness measurement for 5 years of the pavement's life. Field performance results indicated that wheel path cracking was observed on the control section and no cracks were observed on the PEHMA test section.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0090-3973	1945-7553		WOS:000282034800003

The authors' investigation involves the interaction of serum components with fused-silica surfaces under various flow regimes in microcapillaries. Their focus will include the individual components of serum as well as fresh whole serum. The authors studied the whole serum components in our microfluidic system to uncover the responses of proteins in capillary and microchannel surfaces when influenced by the highly variable serum constituents. They have observed the whole serum with a total protein assay by using the bicinchoninic acid assay in combination with a characterization method, such as SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and repeated observations for any change of flow rate in fused-silica capillaries (50 mu m inside diameter) under continuous flow. The authors' preliminary results contradict anecdotal evidence that proteins and other components of serum clog or prevent flow at steady low flow rates. (C) 2010 American Vacuum Society.

In this study, we propose a new methodology for solitary wave generation using piston-type wavemakers by considering the evolving nature of the wave during the generation process. This proposed methodology is tested by conducting a series of experiments in a wave tank. In the experiments, generation of solitary wave profiles predicted by Boussinesq's and Rayleigh's theoretical solutions are accomplished using both the New and Goring methodologies. Waves generated using the Goring methodology served as a benchmark to assess the performance of the proposed New methodology. Comparisons of experimental observations and theoretical solutions for various wave characteristics have shown that the New methodology is capable of generating more accurate solitary waves with less attenuation as waves propagate compared to the Goring methodology. Proposed solitary wave generation methodology is expected to be useful in various laboratory investigations to study different aspects of long wave theories and to simulate tsunamis and internal waves, among others.									5	2	0	0	0	5			0733-950X			WOS:000280953200005

From the perspective of medical device development, the frictional properties between a rigid surface and underlying cells and tissues are of a particular clinical interest. As with many bearing surfaces, it is likely that contact asperities exist at the size scale of single cells and below. Thus, a technique to measure cellular frictional properties directly would be beneficial from both a clinical and a basic science perspective. In the current study, an atomic force microscope (AFM) with a 5 mu m diameter borosilicate spherical probe simulating endovascular metallic stent asperities was used to characterize the surface frictional properties of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in contact with a metallic endovascular stent. Various treatments were used to alter cell structure, in order to better understand the cellular components and mechanisms responsible for governing frictional properties. The frictional coefficient of the probe on VSMCs was found to be approximately 0.06. This frictional coefficient was significantly affected by cellular crosslinking and cytoskeletal depolymerization agents. These results demonstrate that AFM-based lateral force microscopy is a valuable technique to assess the friction properties of individual single cells on the micro-scale.									5	0	0	1	0	5			1996-1944			WOS:000298242500009	21686041

Almost all microbial biodiversity research focuses on "species" richness and abundance but not on their interactions. Although a network approach is powerful in describing ecological interactions among species, defining the network structure in a microbial community is a great challenge. Also, although the stimulating effects of elevated CO(2) (eCO(2)) on plant growth and primary productivity are well established, its influences on belowground microbial communities, especially microbial interactions, are poorly understood. Here, a random matrix theory (RMT)-based conceptual framework for identifying functional molecular ecological networks was developed with the high-throughput functional gene array hybridization data of soil microbial communities in a long-term grassland FACE (free air, CO(2) enrichment) experiment. Our results indicate that RMT is powerful in identifying functional molecular ecological networks in microbial communities. Both functional molecular ecological networks under eCO(2) and ambient CO(2) (aCO(2)) possessed the general characteristics of complex systems such as scale free, small world, modular, and hierarchical. However, the topological structures of the functional molecular ecological networks are distinctly different between eCO(2) and aCO(2), at the levels of the entire communities, individual functional gene categories/groups, and functional genes/sequences, suggesting that eCO(2) dramatically altered the network interactions among different microbial functional genes/populations. Such a shift in network structure is also significantly correlated with soil geochemical variables. In short, elucidating network interactions in microbial communities and their responses to environmental changes is fundamentally important for research in microbial ecology, systems microbiology, and global change.IMPORTANCE Microorganisms are the foundation of the Earth's biosphere and play integral and unique roles in various ecosystem processes and functions. In an ecosystem, various microorganisms interact with each other to form complicated networks. Elucidating network interactions and their responses to environmental changes is difficult due to the lack of appropriate experimental data and an appropriate theoretical framework. This study provides a conceptual framework to construct interaction networks in microbial communities based on high-throughput functional gene array hybridization data. It also first documents that elevated carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dramatically alters the network interactions in soil microbial communities, which could have important implications in assessing the responses of ecosystems to climate change. The conceptual framework developed allows microbiologists to address research questions unapproachable previously by focusing on network interactions beyond the listing of, e.g., the number and abundance of species. Thus, this study could represent transformative research and a paradigm shift in microbial ecology.									13	7	0	14	0	20			2150-7511			WOS:000284718000013

Sensing of the time-varying angular rate for MEMS Z-axis gyroscopes								MECHATRONICS				20	6			720	727		10.1016/j.mechatronics.2010.07.001			SEP 2010	2010	In this paper, a nonlinear estimation strategy for sensing the time-varying angular rate of a Z-axis MEMS gyroscope is presented. An off-line adaptive least-squares estimation strategy is first developed to accurately estimate the unknown model parameters. Both axes of a Z-axis MEMS gyroscope are then actively controlled utilizing an on-line controller/observer to facilitate time-varying angular rate sensing. The proposed nonlinear estimation strategy is developed based on a Lyapunov-based analysis, which proves that the time-varying angular rate experienced by the device can be estimated accurately. Two cases for angular rate are investigated which are time-varying and constant magnitudes. An adaptive controller/observer was also utilized for sensing the angular rate to investigate the performance of the proposed controller/observer. Representative numerical results are discussed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed nonlinear strategy in accurately sensing the applied angular rate. Overall, the proposed nonlinear controller/observer improves sensing the constant angular rate by 50% and the time-varying angular rate by 90% when compared with an adaptive controller/observer.

The samples that were most optimized with the resulting composition (Bi0.48Sb1.52Te3) and specific nanostructures showed an increase of similar to 50 % or more in the figure of merit, ZT, over that of the commercial bulk material between 280 and 475 K, making it suitable for commercial applications related to both power generation and refrigeration. The results of high-resolution electron microscopy and small angle and inelastic neutron scattering along with corresponding thermoelectric property measurements corroborate that the 10-20 nm nanocrystalline domains with coherent boundaries are the key constituent that accounts for the resulting exceptionally low lattice thermal conductivity and significant improvement of ZT.									213	6	0	7	0	214			1530-6984			WOS:000281498200011	20687520	
J	Straka, Thomas J.								Financial breakeven point for competition control in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) reestablishment								NEW FORESTS				40	2			165	173		10.1007/s11056-010-9191-2			SEP 2010	2010	Reestablishment of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) in the American South is a priority of conservation groups. Its original Pre-European natural range of 38 million ha has been reduced by 95% and it is one of the most endangered ecosystems in the US. The species undergoes a grass stage where no stem development takes place that can last 7 years or longer. Competition control can limit this grass stage and increase economic returns. The amount of competition control cost that equals the cost of the grass stage delay would be the most one would want to expend in reducing the grass stage delay. This breakeven amount can be determined using land expectation value methodology and a simple calculation technique is presented. A case study shows that each additional year of a grass stage delay decreases the bare land value of a longleaf pine stand by about 6% annually. A longleaf pine stand with no grass stage delay worth $2,500 per ha would be worth $1,768 per ha with a 5-year grass stage delay. One could spend up to $478 per ha to eliminate this 5-year grass stage delay and still break-even.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0169-4286			WOS:000280650100004

On the quality of discrete representations in multiple objective programming								OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING				11	3			423	440		10.1007/s11081-009-9099-x			SEP 2010	2010	Within the past ten years, emphasis has been placed on generating discrete representations of the nondominated set which are truly representative of the nondominated set as a whole. This paper reviews measures for assessing the quality of discrete representations as well as exact solution methods that attempt to produce representations satisfying certain quality criteria. The measures are classified according to the aspect of the representation which they assess: cardinality, coverage, or spacing. The proposed solution methods are categorized according to whether a measure is integrated into the procedure a priori ( before generation of solution points), a posteriori ( after the generation of solution points), or not at all. The paper concludes with a comparative discussion of these three approaches and directions for future research.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1389-4420			WOS:000280846100004

Gene coexpression networks, built using a set of microarray samples as input, can help elucidate tightly coexpressed gene sets (modules) that are mixed with genes of known and unknown function. Functional enrichment analysis of modules further subdivides the coexpressed gene set into cofunctional gene clusters that may coexist in the module with other functionally related gene clusters. In this study, 45 coexpressed gene modules and 76 cofunctional gene clusters were discovered for rice (Oryza sativa) using a global, knowledge-independent paradigm and the combination of two network construction methodologies. Some clusters were enriched for previously characterized mutant phenotypes, providing evidence for specific gene sets (and their annotated molecular functions) that underlie specific phenotypes.									48	1	0	42	0	50			0032-0889			WOS:000281570000002	20668062

Reproductive hormones, hepatic deiodinase messenger ribonucleic acid, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-immunoreactive cells in hypothalamus in the heat stress-induced or chemically induced hypothyroid laying hen								POULTRY SCIENCE				89	9			2001	2009		10.3382/ps.2010-00728			SEP 1 2010	2010	Heat stress (HS) effects on reproductive and thyroid hormones have been well documented; however, mechanisms of action are not well understood. Two studies were conducted to determine whether HS-induced and hypothyroid-induced effects are similar in the laying hen, with regard to reproductive hormones and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-immunoreactive cells in the hypothalamus. In study 1, thirty 32-wk-old Hy-Line W-36 laying hens, housed at 22 degrees C, were cannulated. On d 0 and then on d 1 to 5 of HS (35 degrees C, 50% RH), a daily blood sample was obtained and assayed for triiodothyronine (T(3)), thyroxine (T(4)), 17 beta-estradiol (E(2)), progesterone (P(4)), prolactin (PRL), and VIP, and T(3):T(4) was calculated. On d 0, 1, 3, and 5, livers were obtained for hepatic type I deiodinase mRNA (cDI-1) determination. In study 2, eighty 32-wk-old hens were randomly assigned to 4 treatments of 20 birds each: 1) HS (36.5 degrees C, 50% RH), 2) thiouracil-induced hypothyroidism (HY), 3) HY + T(4) administration, and 4) control (22 degrees C). Beginning on d 1 of the 5-d study, daily blood samples (3.0 mL) were removed and assayed as in study 1. On d 5, brains were removed from 3 hens/treatment and immunoreactivity of VIP cells was determined. In study 1, HS reduced E(2), P(4), T(3) (P = 0.0001), T(3):T(4) ratio (P = 0.0078), and hepatic type I deiodinase mRNA (P = 0.0204) and increased T(4) (P = 0.0013); there was no effect on VIP or PRL. In study 2, HS and HY reduced T(3), T(3):T(4) ratio, and E(2) (P = 0.0001) and increased PRL (P = 0.0045); HS alone decreased P(4) (P = 0.0001). In HY + T(4), plasma E(2) and PRL were similar to control. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide increased in plasma of HY birds, but there was no effect of HS or HY + T(4). Immunoreactive VIP cells increased (P = 0.0036) in nucleus inferior hypothalami of HS and HY brains. In HY + T(4), VIP immunoreactive cell numbers were similar to control. It appears that HY induced chemically or by HS exerts similar effects on reproductive hormones in the hen; the results suggest involvement of the VIP-PRL pathway even though peripheral blood concentrations were not consistent between studies.									8	3	0	5	1	11			0032-5791			WOS:000280895400026	20709987

Many macromolecular properties are pH dependent, such as activity and stability. However, only activity is biologically important, while stability may not be crucial for the corresponding reaction. Here, we show that the pH-optimum of activity (the pH of maximal activity) is correlated with the pH-optimum of stability (the pH of maximal stability) on a set of 310 proteins with available experimental data. We speculate that such a correlation is needed to allow the corresponding macromolecules to tolerate small pH fluctuations that are inevitable with cellular function. Our findings rationalize the efforts of correlating the pH of maximal stability and the characteristic pH of subcellular compartments, as only pH of activity is subject of evolutionary pressure. In addition, our analysis confirmed the previous observation that pH-optimum of activity and stability are not correlated with the isoelectric point, pI, or with the optimal temperature.

Aspects of taxonomic diversity and composition in freshwater communities are widely used to quantify water quality and measure the efficacy of remediation and restoration efforts. The accuracy and precision of biodiversity assessments based on standard morphological identifications are often limited by taxonomic resolution and sample size. Morphologically based identifications are laborious and costly, significantly constraining the sample sizes that can be processed. We suggest that the development of an assay platform based on DNA signatures wilt increase the precision and ease of quantifying biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems. Advances in this area will be particularly relevant for benthic and planktonic invertebrates, which are often monitored by regulatory agencies. Adopting a genetic assessment platform will alleviate some of the current limitations to biodiversity assessment strategies. We discuss the benefits and challenges associated with DNA-based assessments and the methods that are currently available. As recent advances in microarray and next-generation sequencing technologies will facilitate a transition to DNA-based assessment approaches, future research efforts should focus on methods for data collection, assay platform development, establishing linkages between DNA signatures and well-resolved taxonomies, and bioinformatics.									28	0	0	28	0	29			0033-5770	1539-7718		WOS:000281277600003	20919633	
J	Meehan, Kristin; Jodice, Patrick G. R.								Landscape Scale Correlates of Fox Squirrel Presence on Golf Courses in Coastal South Carolina								SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST				9	3			573	586		10.1656/058.009.0314			SEP 2010	2010	The coastal plain of the southeastern United States has experienced rapid and intense urbanization that has substantially changed the area's landscape. Much of this landscape change has been associated with the development of golf courses and associated communities, and cumulatively, these landscape units occupy thousands of hectares in the region. The opportunity for these golf courses to support native wildlife requires examination as these habitats are becoming more common and often represent some of the largest tracts of remaining open space within an area. Although declining throughout the southeastern US, Sciurus niger (Fox Squirrel) populations are still found on golf courses in this region. We investigated the relationship between Fox Squirrel presence and landscape characteristics on 98 golf courses in coastal South Carolina. Visual and telephone surveys indicated Fox Squirrels were present on 68 of the courses surveyed. The best predictor of Fox Squirrel presence on a course was the presence of a Fox Squirrel population on the nearest neighboring course. The probability of Fox Squirrels being present on a course if they were also present on the nearest neighboring course was 87.3%. Course age was the best predictor of Fox Squirrel presence on golf courses without a Fox Squirrel population on their nearest neighboring course. Our results suggest that regional Fox Squirrel populations may be stabilized by multi-patch population dynamics.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1528-7092			WOS:000208397600014

I do this through a consideration of ideas that were first put forward by Robert Kraut in "Love De Re" (1986). I also evaluate Amelie Rorty's criticisms of Kraut's thesis in "The Historicity of Psychological Attitudes: Love is Not Love Which Alters Not When It Alteration Finds" (1986). I argue that Rorty fundamentally misunderstands Kraut's Kripkean analogy, and I go on to criticize her claim that concern over the proper object of love should be best understood as a concern over constancy. This leads me to an elaboration of the distinct senses in which love can be seen as historical. I end with a further defense of the irreplaceability of the beloved and a discussion of the relevance of recent debates over the importance of personal identity for an adequate account of the historical dimension of love.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0038-4283	2041-6962		WOS:000281216100002

These national networks often promote relevant political issues that constituent congregations may choose to address. Therefore, religious organizations might play a significant role in promoting the process of policy diffusion in the U.S. states. At the same time, congregations are tradition-maintaining institutions that focus first on their own immediate concerns, promoting the maintenance of distinctive regional political contexts and reinforcing the variation of federalism. In this article, we assess the role that religious organizations play in American federal democracy, promoting diffusion or the status quo, with respect to one crucial issue on which religious groups have been particularly vocal: the environment and global warming. We employ two datasets (a large-N national survey and two in-depth survey case studies of clergy in Ohio and South Carolina) and find evidence that religious organizations are vast communication networks that can promote policy diffusion, but typically do not.									8	0	0	2	0	8			1532-4400			WOS:000281586800004

We develop two models - namely, decentralized ordering model and centralized ordering model to investigate the effect of collective ordering by retailers on the total inventory cost of the system. A numerical study shows that the proposed model is robust and generates reasonable cost savings. The models have potential in several multi-level applications such as fresh or frozen food delivery to stores of different supermarkets or the supply of medicine to a number of hospitals from a wholesaler.

Reide; Stone, Katie; Pham, Phung; Mitasova, Helena								Comparison of Darcian flux calculations and seepage meter measurements in a sandy streambed in North Carolina, United States								WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH				46						W09501	10.1029/2009WR008342			SEP 1 2010	2010	We compared two methods for estimating groundwater flux into a stream reach: seepage meters and Darcian flux calculations. Both methods were applied at the same 53 points on the streambed of a 62.5-m-long reach of West Bear Creek in the coastal plain of North Carolina. At each point, a seepage meter was used to measure groundwater flux, v(meter), and several minutes later the streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) and hydraulic head gradient (J) were measured. We compared the 53 paired point values of groundwater flux from each method (v(meter) and v(darcy) = KJ), the integrated volumetric groundwater flux to the stream reach from each method (Q(darcy) and Q(meter)), and the spatial distributions of v(darcy) and v(meter) on the streambed. Values of Q(meter) (268 m(3)/d) and mean v(meter) (0.66 m/d) were each about 0.70 x the corresponding Darcian flux quantities (Q(darcy) = 375 m(3)/d and mean v(darcy) = 0.92 m/d). Despite their differences, the two methods gave the same direction of groundwater flow (into the stream) at all 53 points, a result not found in all previous comparison studies and thus not to be taken for granted. Also, v(darcy) and v(meter) had similar spatial distributions on the streambed. The ratio v(meter)/v(darcy) = 0.70 is within the range of 0.3-7 from previous studies and is closer to 1 than in previous studies. The differences between the two methods are probably in part due to random measurement error and to the spatial scales for the Darcy and seepage meter measurements being of a slightly different size and offset several centimeters from each other on the heterogeneous streambed, but these effects are unlikely to produce the observed consistent bias. The mean bias between the methods (ratio of 0.70) may be related to gas bubbles in the streambed pore spaces (e. g., collection of gas bubbles in the seepage meters lowering v(meter) and loss of gas from the streambed upon seepage meter removal or permeameter insertion increasing the subsequent v(darcy) measurement).									14	0	0	6	0	14			0043-1397			WOS:000281634500001

The concentration of excreted gold nanoparticles increased with increasing extracellular calcium, directly demonstrating exocytosis of nanoparticles and corroborating the inference made from the GP values of the Laurdan dye.

J	Daqaq, Mohammed F.								Response of uni-modal duffing-type harvesters to random forced excitations								JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION				329	18			3621	3631		10.1016/j.jsv.2010.04.002			AUG 30 2010	2010	Linear energy harvesters have a narrow frequency bandwidth and hence operate efficiently only when the excitation frequency is very close to the fundamental frequency of the harvester. Consequently, small variations of the excitation frequency around the harvester's fundamental frequency drops its small energy output even further making the energy harvesting process inefficient. To extend the harvester's bandwidth, some recent solutions call for utilizing energy harvesters with stiffness-type nonlinearities. From a steady-state perspective, this hardening-type nonlinearity can extend the coupling between the excitation and the harvester to a wider range of frequencies. In this effort, we investigate the response of such harvesters, which can be modeled as a uni-modal duffing-type oscillator, to White Gaussian and Colored excitations. For White excitations, we solve the Fokker-Plank-Kolmogorov equation for the exact joint probability density function of the response. We show that the expected value of the output power is not even a function of the nonlinearity. As such, under White excitations, nonlinearities in the stiffness do not provide any enhancement over the typical linear harvesters. We also demonstrate that nonlinearities in the damping and inertia may be used to enhance the expected value of the output power. For Colored excitations, we use the Van Kampen expansion and long-time numerical integration to investigate the influence of the nonlinearity on the expected value of the output power. We demonstrate that, regardless of the bandwidth or the center frequency of the excitation, the expected value of the output power decreases with the nonlinearity. With such findings, we conclude that energy harvesters modeled as uni-modal duffing-type oscillators are not good candidates for harvesting energy under forced random excitations. Using a linear transformation, results can be extended to the base excitation case. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									119	3	0	1	0	121			0022-460X			WOS:000278575000001

Peter brought to his research an intense focus, imagination, tenacity, breadth and ingenuity rarely seen in modern science. His goal was to capture the essential physics of natural phenomena. This attitude also guides our writing: we focus on basic principles, without sacrificing accuracy, while hoping to convey an enthusiasm for the science commensurate with Peter's. The term 'colloquial review' is intended to capture this style of presentation.The diverse phenomena of condensed matter physics involve electrons, phonons and the structures within which excitations reside. The 'nano' regime presents particularly interesting and challenging science. Finite size effects play a key role, exemplified by the discrete electronic and phonon spectra of C-60 and other fullerenes. The beauty of such molecules (as well as nanotubes and graphene) is reflected by the theoretical principles that govern their behavior. As to the challenge, 'nano' requires special care in materials preparation and treatment, since the surface-to-volume ratio is so high; they also often present difficulties of acquiring an experimental signal, since the samples can be quite small. All of the atoms participate in the various phenomena, without any genuinely 'bulk' properties. Peter was a master of overcoming such challenges.The primary activity of Eklund's research was to measure and understand the vibrations of atoms in carbon materials. Raman spectroscopy was very dear to Peter. He published several papers on the theory of phonons (Eklund et al 1995a Carbon 33 959-72, Eklund et al 1995b Thin Solid Films 257 211-32, Eklund et al 1992 J. Phys. Chem. Solids 53 1391-413, Dresselhaus and Eklund 2000 Adv. Phys. 49 705-814) and many more papers on measuring phonons (Pimenta et al 1998b Phys. Rev. B 58 16016-9, Rao et al 1997a Nature 338 257-9, Rao et al 1997b Phys. Rev. B 55 4766-73, Rao et al 1997c Science 275 187-91, Rao et al 1998 Thin Solid Films 331 141-7). His careful sample treatment and detailed Raman analysis contributed greatly to the elucidation of photochemical polymerization of solid C-60 (Rao et al 1993b Science 259 955-7). He developed Raman spectroscopy as a standard tool for gauging the diameter of a single-walled carbon nanotube (Bandow et al 1998 Phys. Rev. Lett. 80 3779-82), distinguishing metallic versus semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes, (Pimenta et al 1998a J. Mater. Res. 13 2396-404) and measuring the number of graphene layers in a peeled flake of graphite (Gupta et al 2006 Nano Lett. 6 2667-73). For these and other ground breaking contributions to carbon science he received the Graffin Lecture award from the American Carbon Society in 2005, and the Japan Carbon Prize in 2008.As a material, graphite has come full circle. The 1970s renaissance in the science of graphite intercalation compounds paved the way for a later explosion in nanocarbon research by illuminating many beautiful fundamental phenomena, subsequently rediscovered in other forms of nanocarbon. In 1985, Smalley, Kroto, Curl, Heath and O'Brien discovered carbon cage molecules called fullerenes in the soot ablated from a rotating graphite target (Kroto et al 1985 Nature 318 162-3). At that time, Peter's research was focused mainly on the oxide-based high-temperature superconductors. He switched to fullerene research soon after the discovery that an electric arc can prepare fullerenes in bulk quantities (Haufler et al 1990 J. Phys. Chem. 94 8634-6). Later fullerene research spawned nanotubes, and nanotubes spawned a newly exploding research effort on single-layer graphene. Graphene has hence evolved from an oversimplified model of graphite (Wallace 1947 Phys. Rev. 71 622-34) to a new member of the nanocarbon family exhibiting extraordinary electronic properties. Eklund's career spans this 35-year odyssey.									8	1	0	0	0	9			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000280548200002	21386491

Elevated SPS temperatures promote the formation of inter-tube connections and consequently impact the electrical resistivity, thermoelectric power and thermal conductivity of the buckypaper. In particular, the electrical resistivity as a function of SPS temperature exhibits a percolation-type behavior while the low temperature lattice thermal conductivity shows a crossover behavior in the sample dimensionality. The results are discussed in terms of the quasi-one-dimensional metallic nature of multiwalled carbon nanotubes, the packing density and the electron-phonon coupling.									18	0	0	1	0	18			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000280548200016	21386505

Evidence for supernova-synthesized dust from the rising afterglow of GRB 071025 at z similar to 5								MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				406	4			2473	2487		10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16772.x			AUG 21 2010	2010	We present observations and analysis of the broad-band afterglow of Swift GRB 071025. Using optical and infrared (RIYJHK) photometry, we derive a photometric redshift of 4.4 < z < 5.2; at this redshift our simultaneous multicolour observations begin at similar to 30 s after the gamma-ray burst trigger in the host frame, during the initial rising phase of the afterglow. We associate the light-curve peak at similar to 580 s in the observer frame with the formation of the forward shock, giving an estimate of the initial Lorentz factor Gamma(0) similar to 200. The red spectral energy distribution (even in regions not affected by the Lyman alpha break) provides secure evidence of a large dust column. However, the inferred extinction curve shows a prominent flat component between 2000 and 3000 A in the rest frame, inconsistent with any locally observed template but well fitted by models of dust formed by supernovae. Time-dependent fits to the extinction profile reveal no evidence of dust destruction and limit the decrease in the extinction column to delta A(3000) < 0.54 mag after t = 50 s in the rest frame. Together with studies of high-z quasars, our observations suggest a transition in dust properties in the early Universe, possibly associated with a transition between supernova-dominated and asymptotic giant branch-dominated modes of dust production.									46	0	0	0	0	46			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000280672600025

In a subset of these grains, we also measured N-, Mg-Al-, S-, and Ca-Ti-isotopic compositions as well as trace element concentrations. The overall picture emerging from the isotope data is quite comparable with that of larger grains, except for the abundances of grains from Type II supernovae (SNeII) and low-metallicity asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Especially, the latter are much more abundant among submicrometer-sized grains than among micrometer-sized grains. This implies that SiC grains from lower-than-solar-metallicity AGB stars are on average smaller than those from solar metallicity AGB stars which provided the majority of presolar SiC grains. We identified five grains with large enrichments in (29)Si (up to 3.5x solar) and (30)Si (up to 3.9x solar in three of these grains). These grains are most likely from SNeII. The isotopically light S ((32)S/(34)S of 2x solar) together with the heavy Si in one of these grains suggests that molecule formation precedes macroscopic mixing and dust formation in SNII ejecta. This adds to the complexity of SN mixing calculations and should be considered in future studies. In total, about 2% of the presolar SiC grains in the size range 0.2-0.5 mu m appear to come from SNeII. This is about a factor of 2 higher than for micrometer-sized grains and suggests that SNeII, on average, produce smaller SiC grains than solar metallicity AGB stars. The high (29)Si/(30)Si ratio in one of the SN grains suggests that current SN models underestimate the (29)Si production in the C- and Ne-burning regions by about a factor of 2. It is shown that with this adjustment the solar (29)Si/(28)Si ratio can be well reproduced in Galactic chemical evolution models and that a merger of our Galaxy with a low-metallicity satellite some 1.5 Gyr before solar system formation could account for the slope 1.3 of the Si mainstream line.									33	0	0	1	0	33			0004-637X			WOS:000280658000027

In solar-type stars, the star-disk coupling is determined by the magnetic field structure, which is responsible for funneling material from the disk midplane to higher latitudes on the star. Here, we use pan-chromatic data for the Herbig Ae star MWC 480 to address whether similar processes occur in intermediate-mass stars. MWC 480 has X-ray emission typical of actively accreting Herbig Ae stars, but with similar to 10x more photoelectric absorption than expected from optical and FUV data. We consider three sources for the absorption: the disk, absorption in a wind or jet, and accretion. While we detect the disk in scattered light in a re-analysis of archival Hubble Space Telescope data, the data are consistent with grazing illumination of the dust disk. We find that MWC 480's disk is stratified, geometrically thin, and is not responsible for the observed photoelectric absorption. MWC 480 drives a bipolar jet, but with a mass-loss rate that is low compared to other Herbig Ae stars, where the outflow is more favorably oriented and enhanced photoelectric absorption is not seen. This excludes a jet or wind origin for the enhanced photoelectric absorption. We compare MWC 480's OVI emission with other Herbig Ae stars. The distribution of the emission in inclination, and lack of a correlation of profile shape and system inclination excludes equatorially confined accretion for the FUSE Herbig Ae stars. The photoelectric absorption data further suggest that the accretion footprint on MWC 480 and other Herbig Ae stars is located at high-temperate, rather than polar, latitudes. These findings support the presence of funneled accretion in MWC 480 and Herbig Ae stars, strengthening the parallel to T Tauri stars.									20	0	0	0	0	20			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000280658000043

In order to investigate the effect of using different transition metal atoms and to further improve the thermoelectric properties, a variety of transition metal atoms (Mn, Fe, Co and Ni) were intercalated into the voids of empty Sb atom cubes. Our results indicate that Fe0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6 and Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6 exhibit a higher power factor than Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6. Fe0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6 demonstrates the highest Zr value at 673 K (ZT = 0.31), significantly higher than Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6. Thermal analysis proves Ni0.05Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6 to be phase stable at least until 1250 K in an inert atmosphere, an important prerequisite for high temperature applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Inhibition of allogeneic inflammatory responses by the Ribonucleotide Reductase Inhibitors, Didox and Trimidox								JOURNAL OF INFLAMMATION-LONDON				7						43	10.1186/1476-9255-7-43			AUG 18 2010	2010	Background: Graft-versus-host disease is the single most important obstacle facing successful allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Even with current immunosuppressive therapies, morbidity and mortality rates are high. Current therapies including cyclosporine A (CyA) and related compounds target IL-2 signaling. However, although these compounds offer great benefit, they are also associated with multiple toxicities. Therefore, new compounds with a greater efficacy and reduced toxicity are needed to enable us to overcome this hurdle.Methods: The allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) is a unique ex vivo method to study a drug's action on the initial events resulting in T-cell activation and proliferation, synonymous to the initial stages of tissue and organ destruction by T-cell responses in organ rejection and Graft-versus-host disease. Using this approach, we examined the effectiveness of two ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors (RRI), Didox and Trimidox, to inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation.Results: The compounds caused a marked reduction in the proliferative responses of T-cells, which is also accompanied by decreased secretion of cytokines IL-6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-13, IL-10 and IL-4.Conclusions: In conclusion, these data provide critical information to justify further investigation into the potential use of these compounds post allogeneic bone marrow transplantation to alleviate graft-versus-host disease thereby achieving better outcomes.									3	0	0	3	0	3			1476-9255			WOS:000282350700001	20718971

The state of the catalyst was investigated using X-ray absorption, and the (n,m) indices of the sub-nm SWNTs were determined from Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence measurements. We find that the size of the metallic particles that seed the growth of sub-nm SWNTs (diameter similar to 0.5-1.0 nm) is highly sensitive to the reaction temperature. Low reaction temperature (600 degrees C) favors the growth of semiconducting tubes whose diameters range from 0.5 to 0.7 nm. These results were also confirmed by electrical transport measurements. Interestingly, dominant intermediate frequency modes on the same intensity scale as the Raman breathing modes were observed. An unusual "S-like" dispersion of the G-band was present in the Raman spectra of sub-nm SWNTs with diameters <0.7 nm.									42	1	0	6	0	42			0002-7863			WOS:000280861300042

Temporally regularized direct numerical simulation								APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION				216	12			3728	3738		10.1016/j.amc.2010.05.031			AUG 15 2010	2010	Experience with fluid-flow simulation suggests that, in some instances, under-resolved direct numerical simulation (DNS), without a residual-stress model per se but with artificial damping of small scales to account for energy lost in the cascade from resolved to unresolved scales, may be as reliable as simulations based on more complex models of turbulence. One efficient and versatile manner to selectively damp under-resolved spatial scales is by a relaxation regularization, e. g. Stolz and Adams [S. Stolz, N.A. Adams, An approximate deconvolution procedure for large eddy simulation, Phys. Fluids II (1999) 1699-1701]. We consider the analogous approach based on time scales, time filtering and damping of under-resolved temporal features. The paper explores theoretical and practical aspects of temporally damped fluid-flow simulations. We prove existence of solutions to the resulting continuum model. We also establish the effect of the damping of under-resolved temporal features as the energy balance and dissipation and prove that the time fluctuations? 0 in a precise sense. The method is then demonstrated to obtain both steady-state and time-dependent coarse-grid solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, there are concerns that printing process may cause cell damages or death. We conducted a comprehensive study of thermal inkjet printed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by evaluating cell viability and apoptosis, and possible cell membrane damages. Additionally, we studied the cell concentration of bio-ink and found optimum printing of concentrations around 8 million cells per mL. Printed cell viability was 89% and only 3.5% apoptotic cells were observed after printing. Transient pores were developed in the cell membrane of printed cells. Cells were able to repair these pores within 2 h after printing. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) DNA plasmids were delivered to CHO-S cells by co-printing. The transfection efficiency is above 30%. We conclude that thermal inkjet printing technology can be used for precise cell seeding with minor effects and damages to the printed mammalian cells. The printing process causes transient pores. in cell membranes, a process which has promising applications for gene and Mactopartides delivery to induce the biocompatibility or growth of engineered tissues.

In the absence of the molecular sieving effect, a linear relationship was found between the adsorption capacities of A0Cs and the surface areas of adsorbents, independent of the type of adsorbent. On the other hand, the pore volume occupancies of the adsorbents followed the order of ACF10 > HD4000 > SWNT > MWNT, indicating that the availability of adsorption site was related to the pore size distributions of the adsorbents ACF10 and HD4000 with higher microporous volumes exhibited higher adsorption affinities to low molecular weight A0Cs than SWNT and MWNT with higher mesopore and macropore volumes Due to their larger pore sizes, SWNTs and MWNTs are expected to be more efficient in adsorption of large size molecules Removal of surface oxygen-containing functional groups from the SWNT enhanced adsorption of A0Cs									80	3	0	40	0	82			0013-936X			WOS:000280727400060	20704238

A Berea sandstone core was contaminated by injecting water containing dissolved 1,2-DCA (253 mg/L) and sodium bromide (144 mg/L) During heating, the core was sealed except for one end, which was open to the atmosphere to simulate an open fracture. A temperature gradient toward the outlet was observed when boiling occurred in the core This indicates that steam was generated and a pressure gradient developed toward the outlet, pushing steam vapor and liquid water toward the outlet As boiling occurred, the concentration of 1,2-DCA in the condensed effluent peaked up to 6.1 times higher than the injected concentration When 38% of the pore volume of condensate was produced, essentially 100% of the 1,2-DCA was recovered Nonvolatile bromide concentration in the condensate was used as an indicator of the produced steam quality (vapor mass fraction) because it can only be removed as a solute, and not as a vapor A higher produced steam quality corresponds to more concentrated 1,2-DCA removal from the core, demonstrating that the chlorinated volatile compound is primarily removed by partitioning into vapor phase flow This study has experimentally demonstrated that boiling is an effective mechanism for CVOC removal from the rock matrix									13	0	0	7	0	13			0013-936X			WOS:000280727400069	20666474

The effects of Y doping on the electrical conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and the thermal conductivity have been investigated in the temperature range of 300-900 K. It was found that the Y doping decreased the carrier concentration and electrical conductivity due to the introduction of hole carriers. The thermal conductivity was also reduced upon Y doping, mainly due to the reduced carrier thermal conductivity. The Y-doping substantially increased the Seebeck coefficient because of the decrease in carrier concentration. Pisarenko plot showed that the measured room temperature Seebeck coefficients agrees well with the predicted single parabolic band behavior as a function of the carrier concentration, suggesting that no additional mechanisms cause the extra enhancement of Seebeck coefficient in the Y Sb codoped half-Heusler alloys. The figure of merit ZT of 1% Y-doped sample was increased by a factor of about 25% than that of the undoped sample. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Mass structure plays an important role in limiting or facilitating O-2 supply, but external factors such as temperature and photosynthesis can play important roles as well. Other external factors are less well understood.Methodology/Principal Findings: We first explored the effects of water flow on O-2 levels inside nudibranch embryo masses and compared the effects of flow on masses from temperate and polar regions. Water flow (still vs. vigorously bubbled) had a strong effect on central O-2 levels in all masses; in still water, masses were considerably more hypoxic than in bubbled water. This effect was stronger in temperate than in polar masses, likely due to the increased metabolic demand and O-2 consumption of temperate masses. Second, we made what are to our knowledge the first measurements of O-2 in invertebrate masses in the field. Consistent with laboratory experiments, O-2 in Antarctic masses was high in masses in situ, suggesting that boundary-layer effects do not substantially limit O-2 supply to polar embryos in the field.Conclusions/Significance: All else being equal, boundary layers are more likely to depress O-2 in masses in temperate or tropical regions; thus, selection on parents to choose high-flow sites for mass deposition is likely greater in warm water. Because of the large number of variables affecting diffusive O-2 supply to embryos in their natural environment, field observations are necessary to test hypotheses generated from laboratory experiments and mathematical modeling.									4	0	0	4	0	4			1932-6203			WOS:000280849100028	20711406

As part of this case study, a framework for determining the average annual probability of liquefaction (AAPL) that is attributed to a known fault is developed. This framework is formulated by considering the uncertainties in both liquefaction resistance and liquefaction loading. For liquefaction loading, the seismic hazard from a known fault is considered: and for liquefaction resistance, soil parameters, characterized mainly by cone penetration test (CPT) and standard penetration test (SPT), and their uncertainties are considered. Additionally, model uncertainty of the empirically-developed liquefaction resistance models, based either on CPT or SPT, is considered in the analysis for the annual liquefaction probabilities. The results of the case study show that the proposed framework is applicable for site-specific analysis of liquefaction potential or for mapping liquefaction potential in a given town (or city). Furthermore, the AAPL and return period determined based on SPTs are found to be comparable with those determined with CPTs. The results of the case study provide some guidance for future engineering planning and regulation consideration in the Yuanlin, Taiwan area. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Regeneration of the articular surface of the rabbit synovial joint by cell homing: a proof of concept study								LANCET				376	9739			440	448		10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60668-X			AUG 7 2010	2010	Background A common approach for tissue regeneration is cell delivery, for example by direct transplantation of stem or progenitor cells. An alternative, by recruitment of endogenous cells, needs experimental evidence. We tested the hypothesis that the articular surface of the synovial joint can regenerate with a biological cue spatially embedded in an anatomically correct bioscaffold.Methods In this proof of concept study, the surface morphology of a rabbit proximal humeral joint was captured with laser scanning and reconstructed by computer-aided design. We fabricated an anatomically correct bioscaffold using a composite of poly-e-caprolactone and hydroxyapatite. The entire articular surface of unilateral proximal humeral condyles of skeletally mature rabbits was surgically excised and replaced with bioscaffolds spatially infused with transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF beta 3)-adsorbed or TGF beta 3-free collagen hydrogel. Locomotion and weightbearing were assessed 1-2, 3-4, and 5-8 weeks after surgery. At 4 months, regenerated cartilage samples were retrieved from in vivo and assessed for surface fissure, thickness, density, chondrocyte numbers, collagen type II and aggrecan, and mechanical properties.Findings Ten rabbits received TGF beta 3-infused bioscaffolds, ten received TGF beta 3-free bioscaffolds, and three rabbits underwent humeral-head excision without bioscaffold replacement. All animals in the TGF beta 3-delivery group fully resumed weightbearing and locomotion 3-4 weeks after surgery, more consistently than those in the TGF beta 3-free group. Defect-only rabbits limped at all times. 4 months after surgery, TGF beta 3-infused bioscaffolds were fully covered with hyaline cartilage in the articular surface. TGF beta 3-free bioscaffolds had only isolated cartilage formation, and no cartilage formation occurred in defect-only rabbits. TGF beta 3 delivery yielded uniformly distributed chondrocytes in a matrix with collagen type II and aggrecan and had significantly greater thickness (p=0.044) and density (p<0.0001) than did cartilage formed without TGF beta 3. Compressive and shear properties of TGF beta 3-mediated articular cartilage did not differ from those of native articular cartilage, and were significantly greater than those of cartilage formed without TGF beta 3. Regenerated cartilage was avascular and integrated with regenerated subchondral bone that had well defined blood vessels. TGF beta 3 delivery recruited roughly 130% more cells in the regenerated articular cartilage than did spontaneous cell migration without TGF beta 3.Interpretation Our findings suggest that the entire articular surface of the synovial joint can regenerate without cell transplantation. Regeneration of complex tissues is probable by homing of endogenous cells, as exemplified by stratified avascular cartilage and vascularised bone. Whether cell homing acts as an adjunctive or alternative approach of cell delivery for regeneration of tissues with different organisational complexity warrants further investigation.									238	17	0	171	0	253			0140-6736			WOS:000281012900029	20692530

As the acetylation time increased, the degree of acetylation increased, and a 75-h acetylation time produced the highest degree of acetylation (DA). The surface morphologies of samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy. Sponge samples were shown by a water uptake ability test to have higher water absorption abilities. An in vitro biodegradation test showed that sponges with a higher DA were more susceptible to lysozyme hydrolysis. Acetylated chitosan sponges were further shown by an in vitro fibroblast proliferation test to have a higher degree of cell viability on increasing the DA, with 75 h exhibiting the maximum effect. The results showed that the wound healing effect of chitosan sponges can be controlled by the DA. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The electrochemical properties of these compounds are strongly dependent on the symmetry of the carbon cage and, except for the Sc3N cluster, are independent of the nature of the metallic cluster due to the localization of the HOMO and LUMO on the carbon cage. The X-ray structure of Gd3N@C-86 shows that the cage obeys the isolated pentagon rule and uses a cage with D-3 symmetry, in agreement with previously published data for Tb3N@C-86, the only other structurally characterized C-86 MN EMF. The electrochemical properties of different MN EMFs are used to probe the structural features of these compounds. Electrochemistry was used to determine the relative abundances of the D-5h and I-h isomers of M3N@C-80 compounds, whereas HPLC allowed the analysis of larger MN EMFs. The binding energies (BEs) were computed for different MN EMFs, and a strong correlation between the BE (of the cluster and fullerene cage) and the corresponding abundance of the given MN EMF was obtained. The results account for the different template stages and for the relative abundances observed for MN EMFs.									21	0	0	4	0	21			1932-7447			WOS:000280360500024

The effective masses and phonon spectral densities of the monolayers seen by different projectiles are discussed based on classical models such as the hard cube model and the recently developed smooth surface model. Large effective masses are deduced for both the monolayers, suggesting collective effects of surface atoms in the single collision event. The effective Debye temperature of graphene was found to be similar to that reported in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), indicating that the graphene is decoupled well from the Pt substrate. A much smaller Debye-Waller factor was found for the C-60 layer, probably reflecting the strong C-60-Pt(111) interaction.									14	0	0	0	0	14			0953-8984			WOS:000285063700011	21399342

The brush was synthesized by a "grafting to" procedure on silicon substrate with a native oxide layer. The overall thickness of the PAA brush in the dry state was similar to 5 nm. Reversible switching of the polymer brush was studied at titration from pH 2 to 10 and back in steps of 1 pH unit. The switching process was observed by monitoring the characteristic vibrational bands of the carboxylic groups of the PAA molecules. Decreasing of the C=O vibrational band amplitude and arising of a COO(-) vibrational band proved the chemical changes in the molecular structure of the brushes due to changes of the pH value in the aqueous solution. Due to the strong absorption of these bands in the IR region, the switching process could be monitored clearly. Switching the brush in several cycles with increasing and decreasing pH value showed a hysteresis-like behavior. For the first time, such hysteresis is observed in titration experiments of polyelectrolyte brushes. This behavior is attributed to the complex mechanisms of the ion's mobility in the brush layer which is explained with a suggested simplifying model describing the influence of ions inside the brush layer. In addition to the IRSE measurements, X-ray standing waves (XSW), in situ visible ellipsometry, and contact angle measurements have been performed and were in good agreement with the results from IRSE. Repetition of the in situ measurement cycles proved the good reversibility of the switching process which is highly important for practical applications of polymer brushes.									30	0	0	3	0	30			0743-7463			WOS:000280353800065	20602533

Andrew								Vertical Integration during the Hollywood Studio Era								JOURNAL OF LAW & ECONOMICS				53	3			519	543		10.1086/605567			AUG 2010	2010	The Hollywood studio system-production, distribution, and exhibition vertically integrated-flourished until 1948, when the famous Paramount decision forced the divestiture of theater chains and the abandonment of a number of vertical practices. Although many of the banned practices have since been posited to have increased efficiency, evidence of an efficiency-enhancing rationale for theater ownership has not been presented. This paper explores the hypothesis that theater chain ownership promoted efficient ex post adjustment in the length of film runs-specifically, abbreviation of unexpectedly unpopular films. Extracontractual run-length adjustments are desirable because demand for a film is not revealed until the film is actually exhibited. The paper employs a unique data set of cinema booking sheets. It finds that run lengths for releases by vertically integrated film producers were significantly-economically and statistically-more likely to be altered ex post. The paper documents and discusses additional practices intended to promote flexibility.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0022-2186			WOS:000289243200004

These models have been developed recently based on new insights from neuroscience and have several advantages over traditional neural network models. In particular, they need far fewer network nodes to simulate a large scale cortical model than traditional neural network models, making them computationally more efficient. This is the first study of the parallelization of this class of models onto multicore processors. Our results indicate that the models can take advantage of both thread and data level parallelism to provide significant speedups on multicore architectures. MPI implementations on clusters of multicore processors were also examined, and showed that the models scaled well with the number of machines in the clusters.

The effect of a surfactant monolayer on oxygen transfer across an air/water interface during mixed convection								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER				53	17-18			3405	3413		10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2010.03.037			AUG 2010	2010	A set of laboratory experiments are presented that reveal the effect of a surfactant monolayer on the transport of oxygen across an air/water interface during mixed convection conditions. The experiments were conducted in a wind/water tunnel where forced convection was imposed via the air flow, and natural convection by heating the water bulk above the air temperature, resulting in mixed convection conditions. The data acquired during these experiments were used to develop a parameterization between the Sherwood number for oxygen transport Sh and the Reynolds Re and Rayleigh Ra numbers. This parameterization was obtained for the case of a clean water surface and for a water surface covered with a surfactant monolayer. The data reveal that, at a given Ra and Re, the presence of a surfactant monolayer reduces Sh by approximately one order of magnitude. The elasticity of the air/water interface which results from the presence of a surfactant is used to explain these results. The data also show that Sh was not sensitive to Re. For both the clean and surfactant cases, Sh increases with Ra. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									6	2	0	0	0	7			0017-9310	1879-2189		WOS:000279077500004

We were able to qualitatively control the amount of InSb nanoinclusions by varying the In and Sb contents in the starting materials. The effects of the nanoinclusion formation and the matrix-nanoinclusion boundaries on the thermoelectric properties have been studied and correlated. In particular, the nanoinclusion-induced electron injection and electron filtering mechanisms helped to simultaneously decrease the resistivity, enhance the Seebeck coefficient and reduce the thermal conductivity of the nanocomposite. A figure of merit of ZT similar to 0.5 was attained at 820 K for the sample containing 1 at.% InSb nanoinclusions, which is a 160% improvement over the sample containing no nanoinclusions.

Representative experimental results are presented and discussed to illustrate the strengths of the proposed analysis strategies on a 510 MW combined-cycle system and a 180 MW steam turbine The phase space analysis provides a means of visual inspection of operational anomalies and also offers a context for numerical analysis of the anomalous behavior The statistical prognostic method provided regression errors below 2 0% for two of the three proposed plant signal combinations. However, all signal combinations offered the opportunity for system monitoring and diagnosis in terms of threshold violations which varied from 2.7% to 54% for these two signal sets.

SPECTROSCOPIC ABUNDANCES AND MEMBERSHIP IN THE WOLF 630 MOVING GROUP								ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL				140	2			293	318		10.1088/0004-6256/140/2/293			AUG 2010	2010	The concept of kinematic assemblages evolving from dispersed stellar clusters has remained contentious since Eggen's initial formulation of moving groups in the 1960s. With high-quality parallaxes from the Hipparcos space astrometry mission, distance measurements for thousands of nearby, seemingly isolated stars are currently available. With these distances, a high-resolution spectroscopic abundance analysis can be brought to bear on the alleged members of these moving groups. If a structure is a relic of an open cluster, the members can be expected to be monolithic in age and abundance in as much as homogeneity is observed in young open clusters. In this work, we have examined 34 putative members of the proposed Wolf 630 moving group using high-resolution stellar spectroscopy. The stars of the sample have been chemically tagged to determine abundance homogeneity and confirm the existence of a homogeneous subsample of 19 stars. Fitting the homogeneous subsample with Yale-Yonsei isochrones yields a single evolutionary sequence of similar to 2.7 +/- 0.5 Gyr. It is concluded that this 19 star subsample of the Wolf 630 moving group sample of 34 stars could represent a dispersed cluster with an <[Fe/H]> = -0.01 +/- 0.02 and an age of 2.7 +/- 0.5 Gyr. In addition, chemical abundances of Na and Al in giants are examined for indications of enhancements as observed in field giants of old open clusters; overexcitation/ionization effects are explored in the cooler dwarfs of the sample; and oxygen is derived from the infrared triplet and the forbidden line at lambda 6300.									37	0	0	1	0	37			0004-6256			WOS:000279958000001

How to build a pectoral fin: functional morphology and steady swimming kinematics of the spotted ratfish (Hydrolagus colliei)								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				88	8			774	780		10.1139/Z10-043			AUG 2010	2010	Aquatic flight is the primary locomotor mode for many animals, including penguins and other diving birds, turtles, and fishes, where labriform and rajiform swimming have been the focus of much interest. However, despite its interesting phylogenetic placement, little is known about the aquatic flight of the sister lineage to the elasmobranchs, the chimaerids. This study investigates the pectoral fin morphology of the spotted ratfish (Hydrolagus colliei (Lay and Bennett, 1839)) as a possible factor underlying the kinematics of their steady swimming by comparing muscle mass, distribution, and abductor to adductor ratio with those of a closely related shark (Squalus acanthias L., 1758). Despite fundamental differences in swimming mode, abductor to adductor muscle ratio did not differ between species (P = 0.49). However, the muscle ratio in the spotted ratfish was similar to the range determined in other flapping labriform swimmers. Ratfish had larger, distally placed pectoral fin muscles relative to body size than dogfish (P < 0.0001) possibly aiding in fine control. Stroke amplitude remained constant across body size (P = 0.26) and relative swimming speed (P = 0.23) in the ratfish, whereas the downstroke was significantly faster than the upstroke (P = 0.006). The similar muscle ratio, despite differences in stroke phases, may be explained by physiological or in vivo recruitment differences between abductors and adductors in the ratfish.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0008-4301	1480-3283		WOS:000281267400003

Cancer cells are also influenced by the microenvironment. It has been shown that, when placed into blastocysts, cancer cells respond to embryonic cues and differentiate according to the tissue type encountered during ontological development. Previously, we showed that the mouse mammary gland was capable of redirecting adult mouse testicular and neural stem/progenitor cells toward a mammary epithelial cell fate during gland regeneration. Here, we report that human embryonal carcinoma cells proliferate and produce differentiated mammary epithelial cell progeny when mixed with mouse mammary epithelial cells and inoculated into the epithelium-free mammary fat pads of athymic nude mice. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of human cell progeny in the mammary outgrowths for human centromeric DNA, as well as immunochemistry for human-specific breast epithelial cytokeratins and human-specific milk proteins in impregnated transplant hosts. It was found that the number of human cells increased by 66- to 660-fold during mammary epithelial growth and expansion as determined by human cytokeratin expression. All features found in primary outgrowths were recapitulated in the secondary outgrowths from chimeric implants. These results show that human embryonal carcinoma-derived progeny interact with mouse mammary cells during mammary gland regeneration and are directed to differentiate into cells that exhibit diverse mammary epithelial cell phenotypes. This is the first demonstration that human cells are capable of recognizing the signals generated by the mouse mammary gland microenvironment present during gland regeneration in vivo.

The fully brominated congener, BDE-209, was detected in approximately one third of the samples at an average concentration of 1.2 +/- 0.72 ng g(-1) ww. Several emerging flame retardants, such as pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB), hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs), and Dechlorane Plus (DP), were detected in these samples. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides were also detected at levels close to those previously published. A statistically significant relationship was found between total PBDE concentrations and total PCB and p,p'-DDE concentrations, suggesting that these compounds share a common source, which is most likely the eagle's food.

PbTe is a cubic structured narrow gap semiconductor that is technically important for thermoelectric energy conversion and infrared devices. We herein report the alkaline hydrothermal synthesis of PbTe single crystal nanosheets of 20-80 nm thickness and 0.2-5 mu m length along the edge. The reaction parameters such time, temperature, NaOH concentration, type of surfactants and reductant have been systematically varied in order to establish the correlation between the recipe and the micromorphology of the Final products. The time-dependent experiments suggest that the formation of PbTe nanosheets involves the spontaneous arrangement and alignment of PbTe nanoparticles via an oriented attachment process, and finally they form a single crystal upon fusion of the nanoparticles. The possible reasons for self-assembly of PbTe nanoparticles have been discussed. We also measured the Seebeck coefficient on a thin film sample made of these nanosheets, which reached the highest value of 120 mu V.K(-1) at 650 K.									30	1	0	0	0	31			1528-7483			WOS:000280471700061

THE ROLE OF RAPE TACTICS IN RISK FOR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND MAJOR DEPRESSION: RESULTS FROM A NATIONAL SAMPLE OF COLLEGE WOMEN								DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY				27	8			708	715		10.1002/da.20719			AUG 2010	2010	Background: College women are at high risk for substance-involved rape. However, most studies have focused on forcible rape and have not differentiated these tactics from tactics that involve drug or alcohol intoxication. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of lifetime exposure to forcible rape (FR), incapacitated rape (IR), and drug alcohol facilitated rape (DAFR) tactics on risk for PTSD and depression. A secondary purpose was to examine the role of different incident characteristics, including relationship to the perpetrator, fear, injury, force, memory, and acknowledgement. Methods: A national sample of 2,000 college women completed structured telephone interviews assessing demographics, psychiatric diagnoses, and rape experiences. Results: Multivariate logistic regression analyses including demographic variables, multiple rape history, and rape tactics indicated that all three tactics were associated with increased risk for PTSD and depression. Correlational analyses revealed that rape tactics differed in relation to incident characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that only physical injury was positively associated with depression and no characteristics were related to PTSD. Conclusions: The strong association between IR/DAFR and psychiatric diagnoses suggests that the definition of rape experiences be expanded to include substance-involved tactics. Differing incident characteristics imply that IR/DAFR experiences are associated with different pathways to psychiatric symptoms in comparison to FR experiences.

Structural Identification of the Monomeric Constituents of Petroleum Pitch								ENERGY & FUELS				24				4301	4311		10.1021/ef1002556			AUG 2010	2010	The monomer fraction of a representative petroleum pitch, M-50, was characterized in terms of both the predominant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) backbones and their extent of alkylation. Such an identification of individual molecular species and their relative abundance was greatly facilitated by the use of a series of separation processes prior to analysis. In particular, low (up to 270), medium (270-335), and high (335-388) molecular-weight cuts of the monomeric fraction of the M-50 pitch were isolated by dense-gas extraction (DGE). The resultant three cuts were then further fractionated by preparative-scale gel permeation chromatography (prep-scale GPC) to obtain narrow molecular-weight fractions suitable for individual species identification by both matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (M ALDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometry and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection (HPLC/PDA). Results indicate that the monomer fraction consists of five dominant series, with each series consisting of 1-3 PAH backbones typically substituted with 0-4 methyl groups. The dominant PAH backbones include pyrene (molecular weight = 202); chrysene, benz[a]anthracene, and triphenylene (molecular weight = 228); benzo[a]pyrene and benzo[e]pyrene (molecular weight = 252); and benzo[ghi]perylene (molecular weight = 276). The highest molecular-weight series beginning at 326 could not be unambiguously identified but may in fact be a small dimer formed by the condensation reaction of pyrene and naphthalene in the starting decant oil, because the UV-vis spectra indicate the presence of a five-membered ring, something not observed in any of the other identified series.									18	0	0	2	1	18			0887-0624			WOS:000281029700025

Larvae of L. sericata were introduced to containers with soil of different compaction levels, with or without parasitoids. Although females of N. vitripennis did not significantly affect the pupation depth of L. sericata, they increased the rate of pupal development by 15.0-23.7 h at 28.4 +/- 1.2 degrees C, and increased the clumping of puparia. Pupation depth of L. sericata was negatively related to soil compaction; mean depth of pupation was 4.4 cm in uncompacted soil and 0.5 cm in high-compaction soil. In high-compaction soil, pupal development increased by 10.5-18.8 h at 25.2 +/- 0.3 degrees C, and puparia were clumped. These results provide a framework for locating puparia in forensic investigations and releasing appropriate parasitoids for biological control of blow flies.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0013-8703	1570-7458		WOS:000279531200004

These responses began with the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and have continued with other negotiations, including the 2009 Copenhagen Summit. These negotiations raised important questions about whether countries will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and, if so, how the burden of emissions reductions will be shared. To investigate these questions, we utilize environmental Kuznets curves for carbon emissions for the G8 plus five main developing countries. Our findings raise doubts about the feasibility of reducing global carbon emissions and shed light on the different positions taken by countries on the distribution of emissions reductions.									12	1	0	2	0	13			1355-770X			WOS:000281048200003

J	Keim, Richard F.; Dean, Thomas J.; Chambers, Jim L.; Conner, William H.								Stand Density Relationships in Baldcypress								FOREST SCIENCE				56	4			336	343					AUG 2010	2010	Stand density indices (SDIs) are surrogate measures of site occupancy useful for developing quantitative management tools for forest types that have not been extensively studied. For example, there has been little research of growth-density relationships for baldcypress (Taxodium distichum [L.] L.C. Rich.). We used published data, forest inventory data, and a 25-year-old thinning study to identify maximum densities and density of incipient self-thinning in baldcypress. Results suggest that a maximum Reineke's SDI is approximately 1,200 (SI units) in baldcypress, which agrees with practical experience and the theoretical limit derived from observed correlations between a species wood density and maximum SDI. Thinning a baldcypress stand to >= 58% of maximum SDI did not affect tree-level or stand-level growth, but thinning to 40% of maximum SDI increased diameter increment and net volume increment (at alpha = 0.07) in the first 25 years after thinning. These results are consistent with expectations based on stand density-growth relationships for other species, which supports the general utility of management tools based on stand density concepts.

However, little has been published regarding partnerships between minority-and majority-serving academic institutions with this same aim. Key principles of collaborative partnerships are used in a descriptive analysis of the development, functions, and benefits of such an interinstitutional academic partnership that was formed to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities in rural South Carolina. Lessons learned from the partnership parallel other human relationships where mutual respect and trust, open and clear communication, and shared decision and problem solving are important for building and sustaining partnerships.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1090-1981	1552-6127		WOS:000280854700008	20547761

In this paper, a folded coaxial guide junction, proposed to be part of a below the feed inductive load, is analyzed. Scattering parameters for the folded coaxial guide junction are developed to replace the coupling of the field accounted for by a coupled integral equation at the aperture joining two coaxial guides. Numerical results are shown to agree well with measurements of cascaded folded coaxial guide junctions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-926X			WOS:000283432500022		
J	Cho, Byung Rae; Choi, Yongsun; Shin, Sangmun								Development of censored data-based robust design for pharmaceutical quality by design								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY				49	9-12			839	851		10.1007/s00170-009-2455-3			AUG 2010	2010	Robust design techniques, which are based on the concept of building quality into products or processes, are increasingly popular in many manufacturing industries. In this paper, we propose a new robust design model in the context of pharmaceutical production research and development. Traditional robust design principles have often been applied to situations in which the quality characteristics of interest are typically time insensitive. In pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, time-oriented quality characteristics, such as the degradation of a drug, are often of interest. As a result, current robust design models for quality improvement which have been studied in the literature may not be effective in finding robust design solutions. To address such practical needs, this paper develops a robust design model using censored data, which is perhaps the first attempt in the robust design field. We then study estimation methods, such as the expectation-maximization algorithm and the maximum likelihood method, in the robust design context. Finally, comparative studies are discussed for model verification via a numerical example.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0268-3768			WOS:000280846600001

The proposed approach is applied to the evaluation of the potential economic impact of the locally grown campaign in South Carolina. Results reveal that the first season of the promotion campaign increased consumer willingness to pay for produce by 3.4%. The change in consumer preferences and the corresponding shift in demand increased producer surplus by $3.09 million. This economic benefit, combined with the 2007 promotion campaign investment, resulted in a benefit-cost ratio of 6.18.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1068-5502			WOS:000281013800005

Effects of oil source and fish oil addition on ruminal biohydrogenation of fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid formation in beef steers fed finishing diets								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				88	8			2684	2691		10.2527/jas.2009-2375			AUG 2010	2010	Four Hereford steers (500 +/- 4.5 kg of BW) cannulated in the proximal duodenum were used to evaluate the effects of vegetable oil source or fish oil quantity on ruminal biohydrogenation (BH) and CLA outflow. Steers were fed 1 of 4 treatment diets in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments ( oil source: canola vs. corn oil; fish oil quantity: 0 or 1%) in a 4 x 4 Latin square design. The remainder of the diet included chopped bermudagrass hay, dry-rolled corn, and protein/mineral supplement. Duodenal samples were collected for 4 d after 11-d diet adaptation periods. Data were analyzed with animal, period, oil source, fish oil, and 2-way interaction among oil source and fish oil quantity in the model. All interactions among oil source and fish oil inclusion were nonsignificant with the exception of trans-11 vaccenic acid (TVA) and trans-9 octadecenoic acid. Intake and duodenal flow of total long-chain fatty acids did not differ between treatments. Apparent ruminal DM digestibility was not altered by oil source or fish oil inclusion. Apparent ruminal digestion of fatty acids did not differ among oil sources but was increased (P = 0.03) with fish oil supplementation. Ruminal BH of oleic and linolenic acids was increased (P = 0.01) for diets containing supplemental canola oil compared with corn oil. Ruminal BH of linoleic acid was greater (P = 0.01) for diets containing supplemental corn oil compared with canola oil. Fish oil addition reduced (P = 0.01) oleic acid BH but did not alter (P > 0.26) linoleic or linolenic acid BH. Duodenal flow of palmitic acid was greater (P = 0.05) for steers supplemented with corn oil compared with canola oil. Fish oil inclusion in the diet increased (P = 0.01) flow of n-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid), trans-10 octadecenoic acid, trans-12 octadecenoic acid, and cis-9, trans-11 CLA. Trans-9 octadecenoic acid and TVA flows to the duodenum were increased (P = 0.01) when fish oil was included in the canola oil-supplemented diet; however, no changes were observed when fish oil was included in the corn oil-supplemented diet (P of interaction = 0.06 and 0.08). Fish oil inclusion increased the outflow of n-3 fatty acids, trans-10 octadecenoic acid, and the majority of CLA isomers including cis-9, trans-11. These results suggest that fish oil addition alters ruminal formation of BH intermediates that is dependent on oil source supplemented in the diet.									21	2	0	18	1	23			0021-8812			WOS:000279796800016	20348369	
J	Ibrahim, Samir; Kang, Qian K.; Ramamurthi, Anand								The impact of hyaluronic acid oligomer content on physical, mechanical, and biologic properties of divinyl sulfone-crosslinked hyaluronic acid hydrogels								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A				94A	2			355	370		10.1002/jbm.a.32704			AUG 2010	2010	In recent studies, we showed that exogenous hyaluronic acid oligomers (HA-o) stimulate functional endothelialization, though native long-chain HA is more bioinert and possibly more biocompatible. Thus, in this study, hydrogels containing high molecular weight (HMW) HA (1 x 10(6) Da) and HA-o mixtures (HA-o: 0.75-10 kDa) were created by crosslinking with divinyl sulfone (DVS). The incorporation of HA-o was found to compromise the physical and mechanical properties of the gels (rheology, apparent crosslinking density, swelling ratio, degradation) and to very mildly enhance inflammatory cell recruitment in vivo; increasing the DVS crosslinker content within the gels in general, had the opposite effect, though the relatively high concentration of DVS within these gels (necessary to create a solid gel) also stimulated a mild subcutaneous inflammatory response in vivo and VCAM-1 expression by endothelial cells (ECs) cultured atop; ICAM-expression levels remained very low irrespective extent of DVS crosslinking or HA-o content. The greatest EC attachment and proliferation (MTT assay) was observed on gels that contained the highest amount of HA-o. The study shows that the beneficial EC response to HA-o and biocompatibility of HA is mostly unaltered by their chemical derivatization and crosslinking into a hydrogel. However, the study also demonstrates that the relatively high concentrations of DVS, necessary to create solid gels, compromise their biocompatibility. Moreover, the poor mechanics of even these heavily crosslinked gels, in the context of vascular implantation, necessitates the investigation of other, more appropriate crosslinking agents. Alternately, the outcomes of this study may be used to guide an approach based on chemical immobilization and controlled surface-presentation of both bioactive HA-o and more biocompatible HMW HA on synthetic or tissue engineered grafts already in use, without the use of a crosslinker, so that improved, predictable, and functional endothelialization can be achieved, and the need to create a mechanically compliant biomaterial for standalone use, circumvented.

While customer helping behaviors have been studied previously, attempts to develop valid measures have been limited. We use the validation process for the Organizational Citizenship Behavior scale as a model to develop and validate a new scale measuring a comprehensive range of customer helping behaviors. We identify multiple dimensions of customer helping behaviors that are engaged in by the same customers, driven by the same antecedents, and collectively form a helping behaviors scale. Using student samples and customers of a non-profit organization, we demonstrate a consistent scale structure, reliability, and nomological and external validity. We present two variations of the scale, one for for-profit companies and one for non-profit organizations. This scale is intended to be used as a dependent behavioral measure to enable researchers to capture multiple customer helping behaviors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Pore structures of these materials can be designed to provide high suction pressure and fast wicking. During wicking, due to the strong capillary action, liquids exert stresses on the fiber network. In this paper, we discuss the effect of stress transfer in the direction of propagation of the wetting front. As an illustration, we first consider a single capillary and demonstrate the effect of a moving meniscus on stress distribution along capillary walls. We then analyze similar effects in yarns. We consider a yarn that can capture an aerosol droplet as a promising sensing element that could monitor the stresses caused by wetting fronts. We also discuss the elastocapillary effects occurring during upward and downward wicking. The distributions of stresses in these two cases are shown to differ significantly. We discuss how these effects might be exploited for designing fiber-based sensors that can probe very small amounts of liquids.

Suicidal, Abused African American Women's Response to a Culturally Informed Intervention								JOURNAL OF CONSULTING AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY				78	4			449	458		10.1037/a0019692			AUG 2010	2010	Objective: This study examined (a) the efficacy of a manualized, culturally informed, empowerment-focused psychoeducational group intervention (Nia) designed in accord with the theory of triadic influence or treatment as usual (TAU) for reducing psychological symptomatology (suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, posttraumatic stress symptoms, general psychological distress), and (b) the effect of Nia versus TAU on the relation between exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) and psychological symptomatology in these women. Method: Two hundred eight low-socioeconomic-status African American women with a recent history of IPV and a suicide attempt were randomized to Nia or TAU and assessed at baseline, postintervention, and 6- and 12-month follow-up. They were assessed on their levels of IPV (Index of Spouse Abuse), suicidal ideation (Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation), depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory II), posttraumatic stress symptoms, and general psychological distress (Brief Symptom Inventory). Results: Hierarchical linear modeling found that women receiving the culturally informed Nia intervention showed more rapid reductions in depressive symptoms and general distress initially, and the between-group difference in depressive symptoms persisted at follow-up. Following intervention, compared with women randomized to TAU, women in Nia exhibited less severe suicidal ideation when exposed to physical and nonphysical IPV. Conclusions: Findings highlight the value of incorporating Nia as an adjunctive intervention for abused, suicidal, low-income women. They underscore the ways the intervention needs to be bolstered to address more directly more mediating and moderating constructs, as well as the need to target more effectively the key outcomes.									29	0	0	4	1	30			0022-006X			WOS:000280823100001	20658802

Recent work on TCM has generated significant successes for a variety of cutting operations. In particular, lower cost and on-board sensors in conjunction with enhanced signal processing capabilities and improved networking has permitted significant enhancements to TCM capabilities. This paper presents an overview of TCM for drilling, turning, milling, and grinding. The focus of this paper is on the hardware and algorithms that have demonstrated success in TCM for these processes. While a variety of initial successes are reported, significantly more research is possible to extend the capabilities of TCM for the reported cutting processes as well as for many other manufacturing processes. Furthermore, no single unifying approach has been identified for TCM. Such an approach will enable the rapid expansion of TCM into other processes and a tighter integration of TCM into CBM for a wide variety of manufacturing processes and production systems.

Such controls may be especially tempting given the findings that favorable salesperson product perceptions actually yield less effort on the new product, and behavior-based controls can offset this tendency. However, using longitudinal data from a sample of 226 salespeople, along with external ratings from customers and archival measures of effort and sales performance, the authors demonstrate that such a strategy is shortsighted. Behavior-based controls constrain a salesperson's ability to appropriately allocate effort across his or her customer base, negatively affecting customer product perceptions and, ultimately, new product sales. In contrast, outcome-based control systems enable salespeople to work smarter, and their corresponding effort on behalf of the new product has a more positive effect on customer product perceptions and new product sales.									31	0	0	0	4	35			0022-2437	1547-7193		WOS:000282599600014

Structural-Response Analysis, Fatigue-Life Prediction, and Material Selection for 1 MW Horizontal-Axis Wind-Turbine Blades								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				19	6			790	801		10.1007/s11665-009-9558-8			AUG 2010	2010	The problem of mechanical design, performance prediction (e.g., flap-wise/edge-wise bending stiffness, fatigue-controlled life, the extent of bending-to-torsion coupling), and material selection for a prototypical 1 MW horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT) blade is investigated using various computer-aided engineering tools. For example, a computer program was developed which can automatically generate both a geometrical model and a full finite-element input deck for a given single HAWT-blade with a given airfoil shape, size, and the type and position of the interior load-bearing longitudinal beam/shear-webs. In addition, composite-material laminate lay-up can be specified and varied in order to obtain a best combination of the blade aerodynamic efficiency and longevity. A simple procedure for HAWT-blade material selection is also developed which attempts to identify the optimal material candidates for a given set of functional requirements, longevity and low weight.									12	1	0	0	0	13			1059-9495			WOS:000280640600003

To evaluate the effect of pore shape, both slit and cylindrical pores were considered. We found that the diffuse layer does not affect the capacitance significantly. For slit pores, the area-normalized capacitance is nearly independent of pore size, which is not experimentally observed for template carbons. In comparison, for cylindrical pores, PB simulations indicate a trend of slightly increasing area-normalized capacitance with pore size, similar to that depicted by the electric double-cylinder capacitor model proposed earlier. These results indicate that it is appropriate to approximate the pore shape of mesoporous carbons as being cylindrical and the electric double-cylinder capacitor model should be used for mesoporous carbons as a replacement of the traditional Helmholtz model.									25	0	0	0	0	25			0884-2914			WOS:000280447400009

We tested our model in two studies consisting of supervisor-subordinate dyads from Australia and the Philippines. Specifically, we found that: (1) supervisor Machiavellianism was positively associated with subordinate perceptions of abusive supervision; (2) subordinate perceptions of authoritarian leadership behavior fully mediated the relationship between supervisor Machiavellianism and abusive supervision, and (3) organization-based self-esteem (OBSE) moderated the relationship between authoritarian leadership and abusive supervision, such that low-OBSE employees were more likely to perceive higher levels of authoritarian leadership as abusive. Implications for research and practice are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									36	6	0	1	0	42			0092-6566			WOS:000281270500013

The progressive incorporation of O at the expense of S was found to increase the density and the glass transition temperature and to decrease the molar volume of the investigated oxy-sulfo-telluride glasses. We also observed a shift of the vis-NIR cut-off wavelength to longer wavelength probably due to changes in Sb coordination within the glass matrix and overall matrix polarizability. Using Raman spectroscopy, correlations have been shown between the formation of Ge- and Sb-based oxysulfide structural units and the S/O ratio. Lastly, two glasses with similar composition (Ge20Sb6S64Te3O7) processed by melting the Ge23Sb7S70 glass with TeO2 or the Ge23Sb2S72Te4 glass with Sb2O3 were found to have slightly different physical, thermal, optical and structural properties. These changes are thought to result mainly from the higher moisture content and sensitivity of the TeO2 starting materials as compared to that of the Sb2O3. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Representative index multistory building configurations were selected from the archetype buildings developed for the FEMA ATC-63. Seismic hazard levels and performance requirements recommended by ASCE 41-06 and modified for use in the National Science Foundation sponsored NEESWood project were used. The archetype buildings, originally designed using current force-based design procedures, were redesigned using the simplified DDD procedure (also described herein) with a range of nonexceedance (NE) probability adjustment factors (C(NE)). Specifically, the design interstory shear forces and the sheathing nail spacings were determined for each structure designed using C(NE). Nonlinear time-history analysis was performed for each archetype structure under the 2%/50 year seismic hazard level and peak interstory drift distributions were developed. The NE probability at the 4% drift limit was then plotted against building height and design charts were developed for each different value of C(NE). Given the building height and desired NE probability, engineers/designers can select the appropriate minimum value of C(NE) using these charts. Additional analyses could be performed to consider other hazard levels and performance requirements. Using design charts of this type, engineers/designers are able to specify a target drift limit as well as a target NE probability when using the simplified DDD procedure. Thus, a true performance-based procedure for the seismic design of midrise wood-frame structures is described.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0733-9445			WOS:000279991700007

The glass viscosity, thermal expansion, and specific heat properties for two commercial optical glasses, P-SK57 and L-BAL35 were measured and are reported in this paper. These data were used with the Tool-Narayanaswamy-Moynihan (TNM) model for glass structural relaxation in order to develop a thermal expansion model that simulates the glass workpiece changes through the critical cooling profile where the final workpiece shape is determined. The results show a structural relaxation model incorporated into an ABAQUS FEM code that precisely models the thermal expansion behavior acknowledging that the theory of structural relaxation is a critical element in predicting the final size and shape of a molded lens.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0002-7820			WOS:000280977300025

Jeffery				Wrege, Beth/B-4451-2008				Striped Bass, Morone saxatilis, Egg Incubation in Large Volume Jars								JOURNAL OF THE WORLD AQUACULTURE SOCIETY				41	4			633	639					AUG 2010	2010	The standard McDonald jar was compared with a large volume jar for striped bass, Morone saxatilis, egg incubation. The McDonald jar measured 16 cm in diameter by 45 cm in height and had a volume of 6 L. The experimental jar measured 0.4 m in diameter by 1.3 m in height and had a volume of 200 L. The hypothesis is that there is no difference in percent survival of fry hatched in experimental jars compared with McDonald jars. Striped bass brood fish were collected from the Coosa River and spawned using the dry spawn method of fertilization. Four McDonald jars were stocked with approximately 150 g of eggs each. Post-hatch survival was estimated at 48, 96, and 144 h. Stocking rates resulted in an average egg loading rate (+/- 1 SE) in McDonald jars of 21.9 +/- 0.03 eggs/mL and in experimental jars of 10.9 +/- 0.57 eggs/mL. The major finding of this study was that average fry survival was 37.3 +/- 4.49% for McDonald jars and 34.2 +/- 3.80% for experimental jars. Although survival in experimental jars was slightly less than in McDonald jars, the effect of container volume on survival to 48 h (F = 6.57; df = 1,5; P > 0.05), 96 h (F = 0.02; df = 1, 4; P > 0.89), and 144 h (F = 3.50; df = 1, 4; P > 0.13) was not statistically significant. Mean survival between replicates ranged from 14.7 to 60.1% in McDonald jars and from 10.1 to 54.4% in experimental jars. No effect of initial stocking rate on survival (t = 0.06; df = 10; P > 0.95) was detected. Experimental jars allowed for incubation of a greater number of eggs in less than half the floor space of McDonald jars. As hatchery production is often limited by space or water supply, experimental jars offer an alternative to extending spawning activities, thereby reducing labor and operations cost. As survival was similar to McDonald jars, the experimental jar is suitable for striped bass egg incubation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0893-8849			WOS:000280646000016

Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine				4	6			491	5		10.1002/term.266			2010-Aug	2010	The fatty layer of aspirate obtained by reaming the femoral shaft using a reamer/irrigator/aspirator (RIA) device was characterized for fatty acid content and the presence of adult stem cells. Gas chromatography analysis was performed on samples taken from multiple patients to determine and compare the fatty acid contents of aspirate lipid samples. All four patients had the same four fatty acids present in the highest percentages: oleic, palmitic, linoleic and stearic. After successful isolation from bulk material, cells isolated from this lipid-rich layer were studied to determine their osteogenic and growth potential on a clinically available ceramic bone graft substitute. The results of metabolic activity and intracellular protein assays indicated that the ceramics supported growth of the cells isolated from the aspirate fat layer, although levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression were low for cells grown on the ceramics. Cells will not transition along the osteogenic pathway when they are actively dividing, and active growth may have contributed to the lack of ALP expression in this study. Isolated cells grown on tissue culture plastic expressed significant levels of the bone marker ALP. The results of this study suggest that cells isolated from the fat layer of RIA aspirate proliferate on ceramic bone void filler and have the potential to differentiate along an osteogenic pathway. Previously considered waste, the lipid-rich fat layer of aspirate may be a source of mesenchymal stem cells that, either alone or in conjunction with currently available synthetic bone graft material, could be used to stimulate new bone growth.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1932-7005		MEDLINE:20694956	20694956

Jenkins, Stephanie/F-5216-2011				Golden Eagle Indifference to Heli-Skiing and Military Helicopters in Northern Utah								JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT				74	6			1275	1285		10.2193/2009-337			AUG 2010	2010	In 2006-2007, during Wasatch Powderbird Guides (WPG) permit renewal for heli-skiing in the Tri-Canyon Area (TCA) of the Wasatch Mountains, Utah, USA, we recorded 303 helicopter passes between 0 m and 3,000 m (horizontal distance) near >= 30 individual golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) in 22 nesting territories, through passive observation and active experimentation with civilian and military (Apache AH-64) helicopters. Flight profiles included 800-m, 400-m, 200-m, and 100-m flybys (horizontal distance from cliff nest on parallel course), as well as approaches and popouts where helicopters flew toward, or popped out from behind, adult-occupied cliff nests (0 m, horizontal distance). Between 1981 and 2007, during the only 8 years when nesting in the TCA was confirmed by presence of chicks, WPG annually flew 108-2,836 helicopter flights in the same drainages on 10-37 days between 15 December and 15 April, with no effect on early courtship, nest repair, or subsequent nesting success. Total WPG operating days (x = 62.4) and helicopter hours (x = 210.6) fluctuated annually but did not increase 1974-2007 (Cox-Stuart trend test, P = 0.371, 0.393, respectively). Apache helicopter testing (227 passes) did not reduce golden eagle nesting success or productivity rates within the same year (t(111,) (96) = 0.495, 0.782, P = 0.622, 0.436, respectively), or rates of renewed nesting activity the following year, compared with 81-101 non-manipulated nesting territories. We recorded no response during 66% and only watching during 30% of Apache passes at 0-800 m from nesting golden eagles. No other reactions occurred until after hatching when <= 4 golden eagles accounted for 5 flatten and 3 fly behaviors at 3 nest sites. No responding pairs failed to fledge young because of testing. Limited fly responses suggested helicopters only precipitated an imminent departure, rather than causing startled, avoidance reactions. Responsiveness between test weeks 1 and 2 decreased (chi(2)(2) - 32.167, P <= 0.001). Apache helicopters were twice as loud as WPG helicopters at comparable distances. Sound decreased with distance, most rapidly when flights were perpendicular to cliffs or ridges. Eagle ambient behaviors and watching the helicopter occurred randomly throughout recorded sound levels during helicopter testing (76.7-108.8 decibels, unweighted). Much helicopter sound energy is below golden eagles' auditory threshold, thus reducing potential impacts. Neither our observations nor our testing indicated special management restrictions are required for helicopters flying near nesting golden eagles in northern Utah. Our results underscore the necessity for circumstance-specific research, as well as enlightened resource management to accommodate unexpected results.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0022-541X			WOS:000280316700013

Dose-responsive gene expression changes in juvenile and adult mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus) after arsenic exposure								MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH				70	2			133	141		10.1016/j.marenvres.2010.04.003			AUG 2010	2010	The present study investigated arsenic's effects on mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus), while also examining what role that gender or exposure age might play. Adult male and female mummichogs were exposed to 172 ppb, 575 ppb, or 1720 ppb arsenic as sodium arsenite for 10 days immediately prior to spawning. No differences were noted in the number or viability of eggs between the groups, but there was a significant increase in deformities in 1720 ppb arsenic exposure group. Total RNA from adult livers or 6-week old juveniles was used to probe custom macroarrays for changes in gene expression. In females, 3% of the genes were commonly differentially expressed in the 172 and 575 ppb exposure groups compared to controls. In the males, between 1.1 and 3% of the differentially expressed genes were in common between the exposure groups. Several genes, including apolipoprotein and serum amyloid precursor were commonly expressed in either a dose-responsive manner or were dose-specific, but consistent across genders. These patterns of regulation were confirmed by QPCR. These findings will provide us with a better understanding of the effects of dose, gender, and exposure age on the response to arsenic.

To obtain realistic physiological loading conditions associated with normal living activities (cycling, in the present case), a musculoskeletal multi-body inverse-dynamics analysis is carried out of a human riding the bicycle. While optimizing the design of the femoral-fracture locking-plate, realistic functional requirements pertaining to attain the required level of fracture-femur fixation and longevity/lifecycle were used. It is argued that these types of analysis should be used to complement pre-clinical implant-evaluation tests, the tests which normally include a limited number of physiological loading conditions and single pass/fail outcomes/decisions with respect to a set of lower-bound implant performance criteria.

On one hand, human-mediated directional selection in crops favours traits associated with the streamlining of controllable and predictable monoculture practices alongside selection for desired trait values. On the other hand, natural selection in wild and especially weedy relatives presumably favours trait values that increase the probability of escaping eradication. Gene flow between crops and wild species may also counter human-mediated selection, promoting the evolution and persistence of weedy forms. In this issue, two studies from a group of collaborators examine diversity and divergence patterns of genes underlying two traits associated with red rice (Oryza sp.), the conspecific relative of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) that is a non-native weed (see Fig. 1). In the first study by Gross et al. (2010), genetic variation in the major gene underlying the hallmark red pigmentation characterizing most weedy rice (Rc) is found to have a pattern consistent with non-reversion from U.S. cultivated rice (i.e. the cultivar did not 'go feral'). This suggests that U.S. weedy rice is not an escaped lineage derived from U.S. cultivated rice populations; weedy rice likely differentiated prior to the selective sweep occurred in this gene within cultivated rice populations. Using the major seed shattering locus sh4 gene and the neighbouring genomic region, Thurber et al. (2010) track the molecular evolutionary history of the high shattering phenotype, a trait contributing dramatically to the success of crop selection in cultivated rice as well as the persistence and expansion of weedy red rice. In this study, the shared fixation of a sh4 mutation in both cultivated rice and weedy rice indicates that weedy rice arose subsequent to the strong selective sweep leading to significant reduction in seed shattering in cultivated rice.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0962-1083			WOS:000280664900001	20701682

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the agents in solution against L. monocytogenes was found to be 2.74 mg/ml for the two nisin blends. The concentrations tested for both nisin blend treatments were 5.49, 10.9, 16.4 and 21.9 mg/ml. Guardian NR 250 resulted in wider zones of inhibition compared to the Novagard CBI at all levels tested. The MIC for Guardian NR 250 in the film was 5.49 mg/ml. Films containing Novagard CBI did not show any antimicrobial activity. A food challenge study was conducted using the film containing Guardian NR 250 at levels of 5.49 and 21.9 mg/ml. Inoculated fresh beef cubes were individually packaged with pre-made barrier film pouches that had an interior cellulose coating containing the antimicrobial agent and stored at 4 C for 36 days. Bacterial colonies were enumerated every 6 days on modified Oxford agar. There was no significant difference in the L. monocyto genes population between two levels of Guardian NR 250 throughout the study. There was statistically significant inhibition of L. monocytogenes for both levels of Guardian NR 250 during 18-30 days of storage compared to a control film without the antimicrobial agent.

Beam-spring model for timber diaphragm and shear walls								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-STRUCTURES AND BUILDINGS				163	4			227	244		10.1680/stbu.2010.163.4.227			AUG 2010	2010	A roof or floor diaphragm in a wood building generally spans across multiple lateral force-resisting elements (shear walls). The diaphragm serves as a horizontal beam that distributes forces to the shear walls. For design purposes, it is common to assume the wood diaphragm is either completely flexible or completely rigid. In North American low-rise light-frame wood construction, wood diaphragms are almost always designed as flexible diaphragms and are modelled as simple beams spanning across two adjacent shear walls. Strictly speaking, neither the flexible nor the rigid assumption is accurate for modelling the behaviour of a wood diaphragm. Full-scale shake table tests of a twostorey wood-frame structure, conducted as part of the NEESWood project, have confirmed that roof and floor diaphragms are semi-rigid. This paper examines the effect of diaphragm flexibility on shear wall deflections by considering the in-plane stiffness of the diaphragm to be semi-rigid. A beam-spring analogue model is used to represent the diaphragm-shear wall system where the shear walls are modelled as springs and the diaphragm is modelled as an analogue beam that acts as a load distribution mechanism. The resulting load sharing among the shear walls is examined and possible application of the beam-spring model to seismic design of wood-frame structures is discussed.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0965-0911			WOS:000280769600003

Materialism and Its Relationship to Individual Values								PSYCHOLOGY & MARKETING				27	8			780	798		10.1002/mar.20357			AUG 2010	2010	The nature of materialism has been of interest to scholars for many years. Of particular recent interest have been the correlates of materialism and their relationship to each other. This study examined the relationship between individual values, demographics, and materialism. Both self-enhancement and self-transcendence values were examined using data from a telephone survey with a random sample of 303 U.S. respondents. It was hypothesized that self-enhancement is positively related to materialism and self-transcendence is negatively related. The results suggest that the relationship between values and materialism is more complex than believed previously. Analysis of variance revealed several interactions that were of potential importance for both public policy and marketing strategy. Of particular interest was the interaction between self-enhancement and self-transcendence. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.									19	2	0	0	0	21			0742-6046			WOS:000280031300003

The apparent viscosity values, measured at the nominal wall shear rates ranging from 500 to 2,500 s (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) using these dies, remain fairly constant. The microstructure was studied in two orthogonal sections: r-theta (cross section) and r-z (longitudinal mid plane). In these dies, the size of the microstructure gradually decreases toward the wall (to as low as a few micrometers), where shear rate is highest. Furthermore, as observed in the r-theta plane of the capillary, for a significant fraction of the cross section, discotic mesophase has a radial orientation. Thus, the directors of disc-like molecules were aligned in the vorticity (theta) direction. As confirmed from the microstructure in the r-z plane, most of the discotic molecules remain nominally in the flow plane. Orientation of the pitch molecules in the shear flow conditions is consistent with that observed in controlled low-shear rheometric experiments reported earlier. Microstructral investigation suggests that the radial orientation of carbon fibers obtained from a mesophase pitch originates during flow of pitch through the die.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0035-4511			WOS:000280405700006		
J	Qaroush, Yousef; Daqaq, Mohammed F.								Vibration mitigation in multi-degree-of-freedom structural systems using filter-augmented delayed-feedback algorithms								SMART MATERIALS & STRUCTURES				19	8					085016	10.1088/0964-1726/19/8/085016			AUG 2010	2010	Due to their ability to augment system delays and produce greater damping for smaller control efforts, delayed-feedback control algorithms have been widely utilized as effective means for vibration mitigation and oscillation reduction on various systems. However, a critical issue remains in their implementation on multi-degree-of-freedom and distributed-parameter (structural) systems. The reason being that the presence of delay in the control loop renders the characteristic polynomial of the transcendental type thus producing an infinite number of eigenvalues for every discrete controller's gain and time delay. As such, choosing a gain-delay combination that stabilizes the lower vibration modes can easily destabilize the higher modes. In this paper, we explore the prospect of incorporating low-pass filters into the control loop to resolve this issue. We investigate the effect of the filter's order and cut-off frequency on the stability diagram in the gain-delay space for single and multi-degree-of-freedom systems. We show that, by choosing the filter's design parameters appropriately, it is possible to increase the stability margins and enhance the robustness of the controller. We also demonstrate that vibrations of multiple modes can be simultaneously mitigated using a single gain-delay combination. To validate these concepts, a controller is experimentally implemented to reduce the vibrations of a macrocantilever beam and a microcantilever sensor. Results demonstrate excellent performance in rejecting external disturbances and reducing the response amplitude under persistent harmonic excitations.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0964-1726			WOS:000279995500016

Thermal conductivity of several low-dimensional crystalline systems has been investigated using our new techniques. The results show that for most of the measured materials in the high temperature range the thermal conductivity is composed of two extremes: a low- and a high-conductive state. The effective thermal conductivity jumps abruptly between these two states giving rise to apparent discontinuities or "spikes". (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

About 50% of US rice is produced in Arkansas and 60% of these fields have some red rice infestation. Red rice populations are morphologically and phenologically diverse. We hypothesise that red rice in Arkansas has high genetic diversity, which underlies its wide phenotypic diversity, and that some alleles from cultivated rice have been introgressed into red rice during more than a century of coexistence. We tested 137 red rice accessions from four ecological zones in Arkansas and 36 cultivars that have been grown in Arkansas in the past century. Twenty-seven rice microsatellite primers, distributed across 12 chromosomes, were used to generate molecular markers. The overall Nei's genetic distance (GD) of red rice accessions was 0.70. Rice grown in the last century had an overall GD of 0.26. The awnless strawhull red rice was genetically distant from blackhull (GD = 0.55) and brownhull (GD = 0.60) red rice types. Nei's GD between blackhull and brownhull red rice was 0.42. Brownhull and blackhull formed one genotypic cluster, whereas the majority of strawhull red rice formed another cluster. Within blackhull red rice, the GD was 0.76, whereas for awnless strawhull it was 0.68, 0.75 for awned strawhull and 0.80 for brownhull types. The gene diversity of blackhull and strawhull correlated with zone of origin. A quarter of the red rice accessions share common alleles with cultivated rice. A diverse complex of weedy populations has evolved in a region devoid of other weedy and wild Oryza species.									24	3	0	24	1	28			0043-1737			WOS:000279539400002

The experimental results clearly show that the electrode nature influences strongly (i) the thickness of the space charge layer, (ii) the X((2)) efficiency, and (iii) the structural rearrangements. Besides, using theoretical models accounting for charge carriers' mobilities, the respective influence of two distinct compensation mechanisms, that is an injection of positive charges (H(3)O(+)/H(+) ions) or a drift of oxygen ions, have been confirmed.									46	1	0	1	0	47			1932-7447			WOS:000280070900052

In this work, we demonstrate that replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REM D) simulations provide excellent agreement with experimental observations We have simulated 20 different mPPE variations in live different solvent environments Experimental results are available for eight of these one hunched systems, and in all eight of these cases the REM D results were in agreement with the experiments Additionally, we simulated and then synthesized two previously unreported mPPEs having both ester and nitrite functional groups After studying then folding behaviors in chloroform and acetonitrile, it was found that experimental results were in agreement with our predictions This illustrates how REM D simulations, which are easily carried out with publicly available software on most modern computing systems. can be used to guide synthesis efforts focused on the formation of macromolecules with specific secondary structures									5	0	0	1	0	5			0024-9297			WOS:000280053000007

To this end a grafted polymer layer (multi-component mixed polymer brush) is synthesized that is capable of reversibly exposing nanometer-sized hydrophobic fragments at its hydrophilic surface and of tuning, turning on, and turning off the hydrophobic interactions. The reversible switching occurs in response to changes in the environment and alters the strength and range of attractive interactions between the layer and hydrophobic or amphiphilic probes in water. The grafted layer retains its overall hydrophilicity, while local hydrophobic forces enable the grafted layer to sense and attract the hydrophobic domains of protein molecules dissolved in the aqueous environment. The hydrophobic interactions between the material and a hydrophobic probe are investigated using atomic force microscopy measurements and a long-range attractive and contact-adhesive interaction between the material and the probe is observed, which is controlled by environmental conditions. Switching of the layer exterior is also confirmed via protein adsorption measurements.									38	1	0	4	0	38			1616-301X			WOS:000280427000005

Protein separation performance of the new AEX membrane adsorber was compared with the commercial Sartobind(R) D membrane adsorber and HiTrap(TM) DEAE FF resin column under preparative scale conditions. Dynamic protein binding capacities of all three stationary phases were determined using breakthrough curve analysis. The AEX membrane showed higher binding capacities than the Sartobind(R) D membrane at equivalent volumetric throughput and higher capacities than the HiTrap(TM) DEAE FF resin column at 15 times higher volumetric throughput. Anion-exchange chromatography was performed using all three stationary phases to purify PA protein. Quantitative SDS-PAGE analysis of effluent fractions showed that the purity of PA protein was higher for membrane adsorbers than the HiTrap(TM) DEAE FF resin column and was the same for the new AEX membrane and Sartobind(R) D membrane adsorbers. The effects of E. coli lysate load volume and volumetric flow rate on PA protein separation resolution using the membrane adsorbers were minor, and the peak elution profile remained un-changed even under conditions where >75% of the total protein dynamic binding capacity of the membranes had been utilized. PA protein peak resolution was higher using pH-gradient elution than with ionic strength gradient elution. Overall, the results clearly demonstrate that membrane chromatography is a high-capacity, high-throughput, high-resolution separation technique, and that resolution in membrane chromatography can be higher than resin column chromatography under preparative conditions and at much higher volumetric throughput.

Refractory inclusions from Vigarano and Allende have larger Ca-40 and resolvable Ca-48 anomalies. These results imply that Ca isotopic heterogeneities were still present in the early solar system at both the mineral and whole-rock scale. The absence of correlated Ca isotope anomalies in leachates from the CI1 chondrite Orgueil containing large Cr-54 anomalies has implications on the origin of the Cr anomalies. Cr-54 has to be produced either in massive stars during s-process nucleosynthesis without accompanying Ca-48 or in particular zones in the rare Type Ia supernovae. In the latter case, Cr-54 has been produced in a zone predominantly enriched in Cr and Cr-54 and not mixed with other zones, or Cr-54 has been produced together with other neutron-rich nuclides and there has been subsequent decoupling of this material in the star, in the solar system, or in the laboratory.									25	0	0	2	0	25			2041-8205			WOS:000279430800002

In this setting, a supplier utilizes a set of distinct facilities to satisfy the demands of different customers or markets. Our model simultaneously assigns customers to each facility and determines the best capacity level to operate or install at each facility. We propose a branch-and-price solution approach for this new class of stochastic assignment and capacity planning problems. For problem instances in which capacity levels must fall between some pre-specified limits, we offer a tailored solution approach that reduces solution time by nearly 80% over an alternative approach using a combination of commercial nonlinear optimization solvers. We have also developed a heuristic solution approach that consistently provides optimal or near-optimal solutions, where solutions within 0.01% of optimality are found on average without requiring a nonlinear optimization solver.

This leaves the Hf-176 excesses that are correlated with Lu/Hf elemental ratios in meteorites older than similar to 4.56 Ga meteorites unresolved. We attribute Hf-176 excess in older meteorites to an accelerated decay of Lu-176 caused by excitation of the long-lived Lu-176 ground state to a short-lived Lu-176m isomer. The energy needed to cause this transition is ascribed to a post-crystallization spray of cosmic rays accelerated by nearby supernova(e) that occurred after 4564.5 Ma. The majority of these cosmic rays are estimated to penetrate accreted material down to 10-20 m, whereas a small fraction penetrate as deep as 100-200 m, predicting decreased excesses of Hf-176 with depth of burial at the time of the irradiation event.									16	1	0	2	0	17			0004-637X			WOS:000280650800021

We demonstrate that the hollow particles are formed on laser-induced bubbles from laser ionized/evaporated liquid during the ablation. The fabrication of hollow particles can be improved by the addition of ethanol to the water, and the particles contain crystalline Al. Our work and the associated mechanism represent a new paradigm to fabricate hollow particles directly from bulk material; that is, the excimer laser ablation produces nanoclusters from the target and bubbles from the liquid, and the bubble interfaces trap the nanoclusters, resulting in the formation of hollow particles.									41	1	0	2	0	41			1932-7447			WOS:000279282200005

Probing the Recognition Surface of a DNA Triplex: Binding Studies with Intercalator-Neomycin Conjugates								BIOCHEMISTRY				49	26			5540	5552		10.1021/bi100071j			JUL 6 2010	2010	Thermodynamic studies on the interactions between intercalator neomycin conjugates and a DNA polynucleotide triplex [poly(dA)center dot 2poly(dT)] were conducted. To draw a complete picture of such interactions, naphthalene diimide neomycin (3) and anthraquinone neomycin (4) conjugates were synthesized and used together with two other analogues, previously synthesized pyrene neomycin (1) and BQQ-neomycin (2) conjugates, in our investigations. A combination of experiments, including UV denaturation, circular dichroism (CD) titration, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), revealed that all four conjugates (1-4) stabilized poly(dA)center dot 2poly(dT) much more than its parent compound, neomycin. UV melting experiments clearly showed that the temperature (T(m3-2)) at which poly(dA)center dot 2poly(dT) dissociated into poly(dA)center dot poly(dT) and poly(dT) increased dramatically (>12 degrees C) in the presence of intercalator neomycin conjugates (1-4) even at a very low concentration (2 mu M). In contrast to intercalator neomycin conjugates, the increment of T(m3-2) of poly(dA)center dot 2poly(dT) induced by neomycin was negligible under the same conditions. The binding preference of intercalator neomycin conjugates (1-4) to poly(dA)center dot 2poly(dT) was also confirmed by competition dialysis and a fluorescent intercalator displacement assay. Circular dichroism titration studies revealed that compounds 1-4 had slightly larger binding site size (similar to 7-7.5) with poly(dA)center dot 2poly(dT) as compared to neomycin (similar to 6.5). The thermodynamic parameters of these intercalator neomycin conjugates with poly(dA). 2poly(dT) were derived from an integrated van't Hoff equation using the T(m3-2) values, the binding site size numbers, and other parameters obtained from DSC and ITC. The binding affinity of all tested ligands with poly(dA)center dot 2poly(dT) increased in the following order: neomycin < 1 < 3 < 4 < 2. Among them, the binding constant [(2.7 +/- 0.3) x 10(8) M(-1)] of 2 with poly(dA)center dot 2poly(dT) was the highest, almost 1000-fold greater than that of neomycin. The binding of compounds 1-4 with poly(dA)center dot 2poly(a) was mostly enthalpy-driven and gave negative Delta C(p) values. The results described here suggest that the binding affinity of intercalator neomycin conjugates for poly(dA) center dot 2poly(a) increases as a function of the surface area of the intercalator-moiety.									35	2	0	22	0	37			0006-2960			WOS:000279197300016	20499878

Specifically, a poly(2-vinylpyridine), P2VP, and poly(ethylene glycol), PEG, binary polymer brush was synthesized on silica nanoparticles via the "grafting to" technique. The selection of the components (PEG and P2VP) for the responsive brush shell was motivated by potential biomedical applications. Poly(glycidyl methacrylate). PGMA, labeled with Rhodamine B, Rh B, was used to form a reactive and fluorescent shell on the nanoparticle surface. The interaction between the particles themselves and the particles and their environment can be precisely tuned by a change in pH. At lower pH, aqueous dispersions of the particles are stable, since PEG and P2VP are water-soluble, extended and contribute to the steric and electrostatic mechanisms or colloidal stability. An increase of pH to 6 causes a slow aggregation as a consequence of the hydrophobic attraction between the collapsed and almost nonprotonated P2VP macromolecules. The aggregation was well controlled and occurred within 90-120 min of the pH change. The aggregation was fully reversible after the decrease in pH. The pH variation did not quench the fluorescence of the colloidal suspensions. The pH-tunable aggregation of the fluorescent nanoparticles could find diverse applications for labeling and contrasting of cells and tissues when the size of the label and the intensity of the optical signals can be tuned by and related to the pH of the host environment.									19	3	0	0	0	22			0743-7463			WOS:000279239900040	20462262

Six papers concentrate on summer mesospheric ice clouds including detection by satellites, radar based derivation of particle properties, and water vapor observations in the mesosphere. Solar radiation affects ice clouds on time scales of the 11 year solar cycle and 27 days. Stratospheric shrinking contributes significantly to long-term trends of ice clouds. The seasonal variability of smoke particles is confirmed to be impacted by global circulation. Six papers address the external forcing of the atmosphere caused by the Sun. The relevance of radionuclei and solar radiation spectral irradiance is presented. The impact of precipitating energetic solar particles on trace gas concentrations is studied. Ion chemistry and electron production can be important to destroy ozone in the mesosphere and upper stratosphere. Strong solar events can reduce ice clouds on short time scales owing to dynamical feed back mechanisms. The 27 day solar signal is identified in ozone concentration using satellite measurements. Model studies show that the dynamical response of the stratospheric polar vortex to solar cycle forcing depends on the phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation. The year 2009 was a remarkable exception from this rule reinforcing natural variability. Regarding centennial time scales it is shown that changes in the stratosphere can influence tropospheric circulation. Tides have extensively been studied within CAWSES. As is demonstrated, nonmigrating tides originating in the troposphere can propagate into the thermosphere.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2169-897X			WOS:000279523700002

Since injected polymeric nanoparticles are quickly taken up by the liver Kupffer cells, we hypothesize that it is possible to enhance LDL delivery to the liver through the use of LDL-absorbing nanoparticles. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach in vitro. We used biodegradable and biocompatible polylactide nanoparticles (similar to 100 nm in diameter) with covalently attached apolipoprotein B100 antibody to adsorb LDLs at physiologically relevant concentrations. We showed that up to sixfold decreases of LDL levels can be achieved in vitro upon treatment of LDL suspensions (500 mg dl(-1)) with anti-apoB100-nanoparticle conjugates. The study of the uptake of the antibody-nanoparticle-LDL complexes by cells was performed using a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) as a model for liver Kupffer cells. We found that macrophages can quickly take up antibody-nanoparticle-LDL complexes and digest them within 24 h. No evidence of cytotoxicity was observed for the experimental conditions used in this study.									17	1	0	10	0	18			0957-4484			WOS:000278711100005	20534889

We find superconducting transition at temperature (T(c)) of 8 K under absent pressure and that it can be induced as large as 2.4 times up to 19 K by applying a small pressure of 20 MPa. A significant frequency increase in the radial breathing phonon mode (RBM) is also found with applying pressure in Raman spectrum measurements. Moreover, B-SWNTs with a diameter of 0.6 nm are confirmed in the Buckypaper. These imply the strong correlation of the pressure-induced Tc with electron-phonon (RBM) coupling of 0.6-nm-diameter B-SWNTs.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1098-0121			WOS:000279472500001

Family Forest Owners' Perceptions on Chemical Methods for Invasive Species Control								INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT				3	3			253	261		10.1614/IPSM-D-09-00012.1			JUL-SEP 2010	2010	Focus group methodology in a field demonstration setting was used to obtain qualitative data on the perceptions of family forest owners relating to treatment efficiency and feasibility of herbicide control methods. Interviews took place on sites where various strategic herbicide treatments were implemented for Chinese privet (Ligustrum sinense) control using the active ingredients glyphosate and metsulfuron. Forest owners expressed unease about the possibility for post-treatment privet reestablishment due to reseeding or other factors and opinions surfaced calling for selective chemicals or application methods that would spare non-target species. Furthermore, treatment cost effectiveness with regard to timber value, the possible need for expensive multiple treatments, cost-share incentives, and treatment guarantees from herbicide applicators were participant concerns. Environmental concerns surfaced about possible effects of both herbicide use and the invasion of privet on natural systems and an unexpected result was a strong feeling among the forest owners that focus groups are a powerful demonstration tool.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1939-7291			WOS:000291707600007

Operator error and system deficiencies: Analysis of 508 mining incidents and accidents from Queensland, Australia using HFACS								ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION				42	4			1379	1385		10.1016/j.aap.2010.02.018			JUL 2010	2010	Historically, mining has been viewed as an inherently high-risk industry. Nevertheless, the introduction of new technology and a heightened concern for safety has yielded marked reductions in accident and injury rates over the last several decades. In an effort to further reduce these rates, the human factors associated with incidents/accidents needs to be addressed. A modified version of the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System was used to analyze incident and accident cases from across the state of Queensland to identify human factor trends and system deficiencies within mining. An analysis of the data revealed that skill-based errors were the most common unsafe act and showed no significant differences across mine types. However, decision errors did vary across mine types. Findings for unsafe acts were consistent across the time period examined. By illuminating human causal factors in a systematic fashion, this study has provided mine safety professionals the information necessary to reduce mine incidents/accidents further.

Cotton Responses to Tillage and Rotation during the Turn of the Century Drought								AGRONOMY JOURNAL				102	4			1145	1148		10.2134/agronj2010.0037			JUL-AUG 2010	2010	Longer rain-free periods are predicted to occur more often in the southeastern United States as a result of global climate change. This nonirrigated field study was conducted from 1997 through 2002, which coincided with the 1998-2002 drought that affected most of the United States. The objective was to determine the effect of rotation and tillage on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) productivity. Treatments in the study were rotation [cotton rotated with corn (Zea mays L.), cotton planted after a rye (Secale cereale L.) winter cover crop, and continuous cotton with no cover crop] and tillage system (conventional tillage and conservation tillage). Two levels of aldicarb [2-methyl-2-(methylthio)propanal O-{(methylamino)carbonyl}oxime] (0 and 1.18 kg a.i. ha(-1)) were also included because of known soil management effects on thrips (Frankliniella sp.) and root-knot nematodes (Meloidigyne incognita). The predominant soil types were Bonneau loamy sand (loamy, siliceous, subactive, thermic Arenic Paleudult) and Norfolk loamy sand (fine-loamy, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kandiudult). Rotation did not affect cotton yield in any year. Tillage did not affect cotton yield in 1997. Conservation tillage resulted in an average 25% yield increase in cotton lint yield over conventional tillage during the 5-yr drought. Tillage and aldicarb affected both thrips and root-knot nematodes, but lack of interaction among these factors for lint yield suggested that management of these pests was not the predominant cause for the cotton yield increase with conservation tillage. Conservation tillage for cotton production could be an important method to help mitigate the effects of climate change in the region if change occurs as predicted.									6	0	0	5	0	6			0002-1962			WOS:000280030300009

The Temporal Nature of Racialized Sport Consumption								AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST				53	11			1645	1668		10.1177/0002764210368090			JUL 2010	2010	An interdisciplinary body of sport research contends that mediated portrayals of athletic conduct are contingent upon the race/ethnic identity of a respective athlete. While prior research has considered how such racialized dynamics become organized, this study extends the research by considering the degree to which temporal dynamics contribute to the consumption of racialized sport. Content analysis of 2,367 lines of commentary talk, enacted among sport commentators in the 2000 Men's and Women's NCAA Final Four Tournament games, revealed how temporal patterns differentially gave rise to the consumption of racialized sport. The findings extend our understanding of (a) the commodification of athletic identities in mediated talk and (b) the prospect of aversive racism in the domain of mediated sport.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0002-7642			WOS:000279225200006

Understanding the Challenges Encountered and Adaptations Made by Community Organizations in Translation of Evidence-Based Behavior Change Physical Activity Interventions: A Qualitative Study								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH PROMOTION				24	6			427	434		10.4278/ajhp.081024-QUAL-252			JUL-AUG 2010	2010	Purpose. Designing programs for mid-life to older adults whose sedentary behaviors are associated with increased health risks is crucial. The U.S. Task Force on Community Preventive Services strongly recommends individually adapted behavior change programs as one approach to increasing physical activity in communities. The purpose of this study is to report challenges organizations faced when translating two evidence-based programs in real-world settings, adaptations made, and whether or not fidelity was negatively impacted by these adaptations.Design: A grounded theory approach to qualitative research was used.Setting and Participants: Nine community organizations across the country participated. Two organizations had more than one site participating, for a total of 12 sites from nine organizations. Within those organizations, 2796 participants were part of the program during the first 2 years. Participants were underactive (i.e., not meeting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American College of Sports Medicine recommendations) mid- to older-aged adults.Methods: Community organizations participated in monthly conference calls, and program information was entered into an electronic database regularly. Data obtained from the calls and database were used fir analyses.Results: Challenges and adaptations emerged in three categories: (1) program logistics, (2) program theory, and (3) program philosophy.Conclusion: Challenges were present for community organizations; however, with some level of adaptation, the community organizations were able to effectively deliver and maintain fidelity in two evidence-based physical activity programs to a large and diverse group of mid- to older-aged adults.

Knowledge about the introduction (s) of this beetle from Africa into and among the current ranges will elucidate pest populations and invasion pathways and contribute to knowledge of how a parasite expands in new populations. We examined genetic variation in adult beetle samples from the United States, Australia, Canada, and Africa by sequencing a 912-base pair region of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene and screening 10 informative microsatellite loci. One Canadian introduction of small hive beetles can be traced to Australia, whereas the second introduction seems to have come from the United States. Beetles now resident in Australia were of a different African origin than were beetles in North America. North American beetles did not show covariance between two mitochondrial haplotypes and their microsatellite frequencies, suggesting that these beetles have a shared source despite having initial genetic structure within their introduced range. Excellent dispersal of beetles, aided in some cases by migratory beekeeping and the bee trade, seems to lead to panmixis in the introduced populations as well as in Africa.									7	0	0	5	0	7			0013-8746			WOS:000279548300026

Capacitated Domination								ARS COMBINATORIA				96				75	86					JUL 2010	2010	We define an r-capacitated dominating set of a graph G = (V, E) as a set {v(1), ... , v(k)) subset of V such that there is a partition (V(1), ..., V(k)) of V where for all i, v(i) is an element of V(i), v(i) is adjacent to all of V(i) - {v(i)}, and vertical bar V(i)vertical bar <= r + 1. Inverted right perpendicular(r) (G) is the minimum cardinality of an r-capacitated dominating set. We show properties of inverted right perpendicular(r), especially as regards the trivial lower bound vertical bar V vertical bar/(r+1.). We calculate the value of the parameter in several graph families, and show that it is related to codes and polyorninoes. The parameter is NP-complete in general to compute, but a greedy approach provides a linear-time algorithm for trees.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0381-7032			WOS:000279160900006

To interpret this large quantity of data and initiate self-consistent analyses of the gas and dust properties of protoplanetary discs, we have combined the capabilities of the radiative transfer code MCFOST with the gas thermal balance and chemistry code ProDiMo to compute a grid of approximate to 300 000 disc models (DENT). We present a comparison of the first Herschel/GASPS line and continuum data with the predictions from the DENT grid of models. Our objective is to test some of the main trends already identified in the DENT grid, as well as to define better empirical diagnostics to estimate the total gas mass of protoplanetary discs. Photospheric UV radiation appears to be the dominant gas-heating mechanism for Herbig stars, whereas UV excess and/or X-rays emission dominates for T Tauri stars. The DENT grid reveals the complexity in the analysis of far-IR lines and the difficulty to invert these observations into physical quantities. The combination of Herschel line observations with continuum data and/or with rotational lines in the (sub-)millimetre regime, in particular CO lines, is required for a detailed characterisation of the physical and chemical properties of circumstellar discs.									19	0	0	0	0	19			0004-6361			WOS:000281527200127

Circumstellar discs are ubiquitous around young stars, but rapidly dissipate their gas and dust on timescales of a few Myr. The Herschel Space Observatory allows for the study of the warm disc atmosphere, using far-infrared spectroscopy to measure gas content and excitation conditions, and far-IR photometry to constrain the dust distribution.Aims. We aim to detect and characterize the gas content of circumstellar discs in four targets as part of the Herschel science demonstration phase.Methods. We carried out sensitive medium resolution spectroscopy and high sensitivity photometry at gimel similar to 60-190 mu m using the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer instrument on the Herschel Space Observatory.Results. We detect [OI] 63 mu m emission from the young stars HD 169142, TW Hydrae, and RECX 15, but not HD 181327. No other lines, including [CII] 158 and [OI] 145, are significantly detected.

This work is part of the open time key program GASPS, which is aimed at studying the evolution of protoplanetary discs. To constrain the gas properties in the outer disc, we observed the star at several key gas-lines, including [OI] 63.2 and 145.5 mu m, [CII] 157.7 mu m, CO 72.8 and 90.2 mu m, and o-H(2)O 78.7 and 179.5 mu m. We only detect the [OI] 63.2 mu m line in our spectra, and derive upper limits for the other lines. We complement our data set with PACS photometry and (12/13)CO data obtained with the Submillimeter Array. Furthermore, we derive accurate stellar parameters from optical spectra and UV to mm photometry. We model the dust continuum with the 3D radiative transfer code MCFOST and use this model as an input to analyse the gas lines with the thermo-chemical code ProDIMo. Our dataset is consistent with a simple model in which the gas and dust are well-mixed in a disc with a continuous structure between 20 and 200 AU, but this is not a unique solution. Our modelling effort allows us to constrain the gas-to-dust mass ratio as well as the relative abundance of the PAHs in the disc by simultaneously fitting the lines of several species that originate in different regions. Our results are inconsistent with a gas-poor disc with a large UV excess; a gas mass of 5.0 +/- 2.0 x 10(-3) M(circle dot) is still present in this disc, in agreement with earlier CO observations.									28	1	0	0	0	29			0004-6361			WOS:000281527200125

With an age of similar to 10 Myr, TW Hya is one of the nearest T Tauri stars that is still surrounded by a relatively massive disk. In addition a large number of molecules has been found in the TW Hya disk, making TW Hya the perfect test case in a large survey of disks with Herschel-PACS to directly study their gaseous component. We aim to constrain the gas and dust mass of the circumstellar disk around TW Hya. We observed the fine-structure lines of [OI] and [CII] as part of the open-time large program GASPS. We complement this with continuum data and ground-based (12) CO 3-2 and (13)CO 3-2 observations. We simultaneously model the continuum and the line fluxes with the 3D Monte-Carlo code MCFOST and the thermo-chemical code ProDiMo to derive the gas and dust masses. We detect the [OI] line at 63 mu m. The other lines that were observed, [OI] at 145 mu m and [CII] at 157 mu m, are not detected. No extended emission has been found. Preliminary modeling of the photometric and line data assuming [(12)CO]/[(13)CO] = 69 suggests a dust mass for grains with radius < 1 mm of similar to 1.9 x 10(-4) M(circle dot) (total solid mass of 3 x 10(-3) M(circle dot)) and a gas mass of (0.5-5) x 10(-3) M(circle dot). The gas-to-dust mass may be lower than the standard interstellar value of 100.									43	1	0	0	0	44			0004-6361			WOS:000281527200126		
J	Nath, Nitendra; Tatlicioglu, Enver; Dawson, Darren M.								Range identification for nonlinear parameterizable paracatadioptric systems								AUTOMATICA				46	7			1129	1140		10.1016/j.automatica.2010.03.017			JUL 2010	2010	In this paper, a new range identification technique for a calibrated paracatadioptric system mounted on a moving platform is developed to recover the range information and the three-dimensional (3D) Euclidean coordinates of a static object feature. The position of the moving platform is assumed to be measurable. To identify the unknown range, first, a function of the projected pixel coordinates is related to the unknown 3D Euclidean coordinates of an object feature. This function is nonlinearly parameterized (i.e., the unknown parameters appear nonlinearly in the parameterized model). An adaptive estimator based on a min-max algorithm is then designed to estimate the unknown 3D Euclidean coordinates of an object feature relative to a fixed reference frame which facilitates the identification of range. A Lyapunov-type stability analysis is used to show that the developed estimator provides an estimation of the unknown parameters within a desired precision. Numerical simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed range estimation technique. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Shepherd, Marion W., Jr.; Singh, Randhir; Kim, Jinkyung; Jiang, Xiuping								Effect of heat-shock treatment on the survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium in dairy manure co-composted with vegetable wastes under field conditions								BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY				101	14			5407	5413		10.1016/j.biortech.2010.01.147			JUL 2010	2010	This study investigated the survival of heat-shocked (HS) and non-heat-shocked (NHS) Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium when co-composting dairy manure and vegetable wastes in a field setting. In the summer, HS E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella survived for 7 and 2 days longer at the surface and bottom locations of the compost heaps, respectively, than NHS cultures. Both HS and NHS E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella were detectable in all compost samples for more than 60 days in the winter. The results indicate that composting dairy manure with vegetable wastes under sub-optimal conditions may allow extended survival of pathogens in the heap at low ambient temperature. Analysis of covariance revealed that the heat-shock treatment may have induced cross-resistance to desiccation, allowing extended survival of HS E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella at the surface of the compost heaps during the summer.

A dendrochronological analysis of a disturbance-succession model for oak-pine forests of the Appalachian Mountains, USA								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE				40	7			1373	1385		10.1139/X10-077			JUL 2010	2010	Disturbance-succession models describe the relationship between the disturbance regime and the dominant tree species of a forest type. Such models are useful tools in ecosystem management and restoration, provided they are accurate. We tested a disturbance-succession model for the oak-pine (Quercus spp. - Pinus spp.) forests of the Appalachian Mountains region using dendrochronological techniques. In this model, fire promotes pines, while fire suppression, bark beetle outbreaks, and ice storms encourage oaks. We analyzed nine Appalachian oak-pine stands for species establishment dates and the occurrence of fires and canopy disturbances. We found no evidence that fire preferentially promoted the establishment of pine more than oak, nor did we find any evidence that canopy disturbances or periods of no disturbance facilitated the establishment of oak more than pine. Rather, we found that both species groups originated primarily after combined canopy and fire disturbances, and reduction of fire frequency and scope coincided with the cessation of successful oak and pine regeneration. Currently, heath shrubs are slowly dominating these stands, so we present a revised disturbance-succession model for land managers struggling to manage or restore oak-pine forests containing a dense ericaceous understory.									5	0	0	5	0	6			0045-5067			WOS:000281208900015

Physical activity and healthy dietary practices can reduce this risk. The church is a promising setting to address health disparities, and community-based participatory research is a preferred approach.Objectives: Using a community-based participatory approach and the social ecologic model, the FAN trial aims to increase self-reported moderate-intensity physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption and reduce blood pressure in African American church members. Secondary aims are to increase objectively measured moderate-intensity physical activity and fiber/whole grain consumption and reduce fat consumption.Design: FAN is a group randomized trial (GRT) with two levels of clustering: participants (N = 1279; n = 316 accelerometer subgroup) within church and church within church cluster. In the first wave, seven clusters including 23 churches were randomized to an immediate intervention or delayed intervention. In subsequent waves, 51 churches were randomized to an immediate or delayed intervention.Methods: Church committee members, pastors, and cooks participate in full-day trainings to learn how to implement physical activity and dietary changes in the church. Monthly mailings and technical assistance calls are delivered over the 15-month intervention. Members complete measurements at baseline and 15 months. A detailed process evaluation is included.Summary: FAN focuses on modifying the social, cultural, and policy environment in a faith-based setting. The use of a community-based participatory research approach, engagement of church leaders, inclusion of a detailed process evaluation, and a formal plan for sustainability and dissemination make FAN unique.

In particular, very little is known about the evolution of cerebellar contribution to complex behavior in higher primate species. In this paper, we provide an overview of existing and ongoing comparative studies of the role of the cerebellum in primate behavior. In particular, we discuss evidence that great apes show greater cerebellar relative size than monkeys and that such interspecific difference is mainly explained by growth of the lateral neocerebellum in evolution with converse changes in the vermis. Furthermore, we present evidence that volumetric differences as well as lateral asymmetry of the cerebellum are related to both performance and hand preference for skilled tasks like tool use and aimed throwing. Finally we suggest future directions for this comparative research area that may offer further valuable clues into the involvement of the cerebellum in complex behavior and its evolutionary origin in primate species.

J	Moss, Jason D.; Muth, Eric R.; Tyrrell, Richard A.; Stephens, Benjamin R.								Perceptual thresholds for display lag in a real visual environment are not affected by field of view or psychophysical technique								DISPLAYS				31	3			143	149		10.1016/j.displa.2010.04.002			JUL 2010	2010	Introduction: Lag between head movement and the time to render the visual consequences of the movement during head mounted display (HMD) applications presents challenges in the appearance of a stable image. This appearance of an image to "lag" behind or "swim" about may cause detriments in user performance, lack of user acceptance, and simulator sickness. These known potential consequences of HMD use motivated the current work to explore the human capability to detect display lag. The aim in this study was to gain a better understanding of the threshold for display lag detection and what variables affect this threshold.Methods: Twenty four subjects completed a repeated-measures three field of view (FOV: 10 degrees, 38 degrees, and full monocular) X two psychophysical technique (forced-choice and simple) experimental design. Passive sinusoidal head movements about the yaw axis were generated by an oscillating chair. A visual scene consisting of vertical bars was projected by an optokinetic drum moving in a sinusoidal fashion with the subjects. Subjects reported whether the scene lagged behind head movement.Results: The grand threshold mean for lag detection was 147.64 ms (SD = 84.91). The median was 130 ms and the 25th and 75th percentiles were 84.17 ms and 206.25 ms, respectively. Lag thresholds were not systematically influenced by either FOV or psychophysical technique.Discussion: Naive subjects in the current study were less sensitive to lag as compared to thresholds reported in previous HMD studies, which provided lag detection strategies and practice [e.g., 77 ms; Ellis, Mania, Adelstein, & Hill, 2004]. Future examinations using the current paradigm should provide detection strategies and more practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper uses an alternative source with heights and weights of ordinary people employed in a wide variety of occupations. The results reveal the operation of the antebellum paradox in that average heights declined between men born circa 1820 and those born circa 1840. Average weights also declined for adult males, suggesting a decline in mid-19th century nutritional status. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, exemplary buildings demonstrate the feasibility of much better energy performance at no additional first cost. This research examines one possible explanation for this inconsistency. The aim is to investigate whether the anchoring bias, which refers to our tendency to gravitate towards a pre-defined standard regardless of its relevance, influences energy performance goals in building design. The scope examines professionals who help set energy performance goals for U.S. buildings. Prior to being asked to set an energy performance goal, these professionals were randomly directed to one of three series of questions. One series set an anchor of 90% energy reduction beyond standard practice, one set a 30% anchor, and one set no anchor. Respondents exposed to the 90% anchor, and respondents exposed to no anchor at all, set higher energy performance goals than respondents exposed to the 30% anchor. These results suggest that building rating systems that only reward incremental energy improvements may inadvertently create anchors, thereby discouraging more advanced energy performance goals and inhibiting energy performance that is technically and economically feasible.

We use data from a large scale Web survey hosted on National Geographic's Web site in 2001-2002 to investigate this premise. We examine whether reading three classic environmental books (Walden, A Sand County Almanac, and Silent Spring) is associated with the likelihood of engaging in ERB. Conceptualizing this activity as a formative experience and a source of environmental knowledge, we hypothesized that reading such literature would be a stronger predictor of ERB than sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., gender, education, and political orientation), general environmental attitudes (as measured by the New Ecological Paradigm), and concern about specific environmental risks. The results indicated that while reading environmental literature was a stronger predictor of ERB than background characteristics and the NEP, environmental concern was an even stronger predictor. We offer reasons for these findings and make suggestions for environmental education and future research.									57	0	0	7	2	59			0013-9165			WOS:000278976800002

An information- theoretic approach was used on data from 197 salvaged bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephulus) eggs (159 clutches) that failed to hatch in Michigan and Ohio, USA (1986-2000). Contaminant levels declined over time while eggshell thickness increased, and by 2000 was at pre-1946 levels. The number of occupied territories and productivity increased during 1981 to 2004. For both the entire dataset and a subset of nests along the Great Lakes shoreline, polychlorinated biphenyls (Sigma PCBs, fresh wet wt) were generally included in the most parsimonious models (lowest-Akaike's information criterion [AICs]) describing productivity, with significant declines in productivity observed above 26 mu g/g Sigma PCBs (fresh wet wt). Of 73 eggs with a visible embryo, eight (11%) were abnormal, including three with skewed bills, but they were not associated with known teratogens, including Sigma PCBs. Eggs with visible embryos had greater concentrations of all measured contaminants than eggs without visible embryos; the most parsimonious models describing the presence of visible embryos incorporated dieldrin equivalents and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE). There were significant negative correlations between eggshell thickness and all contaminants, with Sigma PCBs included in the most parsimonious models. There were, however, no relationships between productivity and eggshell thickness or Ratcliffe's index. The Sigma PCBs and DDE were negatively associated with nest success of bald eagles in the Great Lakes watersheds, but the mechanism does not appear robe via shell quality effects, at least at current contaminant levels, while it is not clear what other mechanisms were involved.

In all, 267 (59%) of the markers were informative for at least one of the 11 mapping populations, which segregate for traits like drought and salinity tolerance; host plant resistance to downy mildew, rust and blast; fertility restoration and sterility and maintenance of cytoplasmic male sterility etc. An average of 116 polymorphic markers was identified per mapping population. The average PIC values and number of profiles (P) per polymorphic marker were: gSSRs (PIC = 0.62, P = 6.1), ISHs (PIC = 0.39, P = 2.6), eSSRs (PIC = 0.36, P = 3.1) and ESHs (PIC = 0.35, P = 3.1). A high correlation (r > 0.97, P < 0.05) was observed between the patterns of diversity exposed by the different marker systems. The polymorphic markers identified are suitable for the de novo construction, or the supplementation of pearl millet linkage maps.

Low temperature operability and oxidative stability of CSME was determined by cloud point (CP), pour point (PP), cold filter plugging point (CFPP), and oxidative stability index (OSI). The most significant reductions in CP, PP, and CFPP in all cases were obtained with Technol (R), with the average reduction in temperature found to be 3.9 degrees C. Gunk (R), Heet (R), and Howe's (R) were progressively less effective, as indicated by average reductions in temperature of 3.4, 3.0, and 2.8 degrees C, respectively. In all cases, the magnitude of CFPP reduction was greater than for PP and especially CP. Addition of gossypol, a polyphenolic aldehyde, resulted in linear improvement in OSI (R(2) = 0.9804). The OSI of CSME increased from 5.0 to 8.3 h with gossypol at a concentration of 1000 ppm.									15	0	0	7	0	15			1438-7697			WOS:000280628700014		
J	Liang, Haiying; Barakat, Abdelali; Schlarbaum, Scott E.; Mandoli, Dina F.; Carlson, John E.								Comparison of gene order of GIGANTEA loci in yellow-poplar, monocots, and eudicots								GENOME				53	7			533	544		10.1139/G10-031			JUL 2010	2010	GIGANTEA plays an important role in the control of circadian rhythms and photoperiodic flowering. The GIGANTEA gene has been studied in various species, but not in basal angiosperms. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no study of the genome organization of a basal angiosperm has yet been published. In this study, we sequenced a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) harboring GIGANTEA from yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) and compared the genomic organization of this gene in yellow-poplar with that in other species from various angiosperm clades. This is the first report on the gene structure and organization of a large contig in any basal angiosperm species. The BAC clone, covering a region of approximately 122 kb from the yellow-poplar genome, was sequenced and assembled by coupling the 454 pyrosequencing technology with ABI capillary sequencing. In addition to GIGANTEA, the gene RPS18.A (encoding ribosomal protein S18.A) was found in this segment of the genome. We found that gene content and order in this region of the yellow-poplar genome were similar to those in the corresponding region in eudicots but not in Oryza sativa and Sorghum bicolor, implying that clustering of the GIGANTEA and RPS18.A genes is ancestral and separation of the genes occurred after the phylogenetic split of monocots from dicots. Phylogenetic analysis of GIGANTEA amino acid sequences placed yellow-poplar closer to eudicots than to monocots. In addition, evidence for transposition and large insertions and duplications was found, suggesting multiple and complex mechanisms of basal angiosperm genome evolution.									5	2	0	4	0	6			0831-2796			WOS:000280731300004	20616875	
J	Moysey, Stephen M. J.				Moysey, Stephen/H-4658-2012				Hydrologic trajectories in transient ground-penetrating-radar reflection data								GEOPHYSICS				75	4			WA211	WA219		10.1190/1.3463416			JUL-AUG 2010	2010	A variable-rate infiltration experiment was conducted in a sandbox to demonstrate that distinctive patterns are produced in transient ground-penetrating-radar (GPR) data collected during wetting, and drying events. The observed GPR response was found to be very consistent with the results of numerical simulations performed using finite-difference time-domain modeling of GPR coupled with a 1D unsaturated flow model (HYDRUS-1D) for which the sand hydraulic properties were determined independently using core samples. Despite this agreement, few methods are available that can efficiently analyze transient GPR data to make a quantitative link between observed responses and the hydraulic properties of soils. To address this problem, a computationally efficient method is proposed that is analogous to coherency analysis used in multioffset surveys. The new method is based on the calculation of semblance along trajectories through transient GPR data. Each trajectory represents a specific GPR arrival, e.g., the ground wave and reflections from the wetting front and subsurface boundaries. The specific path of the trajectories is controlled by the hydraulic properties of the soil, just as the normal-moveout trajectories used to calculate semblance in multioffset data are controlled by wave velocity. Because the method is based on the output of 1D unsaturated flow models, it can be used for situations with complex hydrologic boundary conditions. Good agreement was found in this study between the calculated trajectories and the arrivals observed for both simulated and empirical GPR data. A sensitivity analysis performed in this study suggests that most parameters of the Mualem-van Genuchten soil model can be identified using this approach to coherency analysis of transient GPR data.									12	0	0	2	0	12			0016-8033			WOS:000283910000054

This method is applied to the accurate modeling of the feed of a simple cylindrical monopole antenna. A microwave network is developed to replace the effects of coupled fields due to one of the unknowns. Computed reflection coefficient values are shown to agree well with values measured on laboratory models and a method of moments solution not incorporating network principles.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-926X			WOS:000281960100018

Evaluation of the Cognitive Effects of Travel Technique in Complex Real and Virtual Environments								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS				16	4			690	702		10.1109/TVCG.2009.93			JUL-AUG 2010	2010	We report a series of experiments conducted to investigate the effects of travel technique on information gathering and cognition in complex virtual environments. In the first experiment, participants completed a non-branching multilevel 3D maze at their own pace using either real walking or one of two virtual travel techniques. In the second experiment, we constructed a real-world maze with branching pathways and modeled an identical virtual environment. Participants explored either the real or virtual maze for a predetermined amount of time using real walking or a virtual travel technique. Our results across experiments suggest that for complex environments requiring a large number of turns, virtual travel is an acceptable substitute for real walking if the goal of the application involves learning or reasoning based on information presented in the virtual world. However, for applications that require fast, efficient navigation or travel that closely resembles real-world behavior, real walking has advantages over common joystick-based virtual travel techniques.									20	0	0	0	0	20			1077-2626			WOS:000277650300014	20467065

Many resources have been dedicated to the control of established beach vitex stands. Successful eradication will require knowledge of this plant's ability to reestablish from seed after control efforts. To understand seed-based regenerative potential, studies were conducted to characterize the fruits and seeds, document the existence and size of seed banks, determine stratification requirements for germination, and ascertain seed dormancy mechanisms. Studies of fruit lots from three consecutive years (2003 to 2005) found that the average fruit contained 1.39 seeds, and more than 76% of fruits contained at least one viable seed. A positive correlation existed between seed number and both fruit mass and fruit diameter. A substantial soil seed bank was discovered that contained viable seeds 4 yr after vegetation removal. Stratification was required for seed germination. All stratification treatments induced germination, with highest rates realized when stratification was performed at 10 C for 8 or 12 wk. Germination rates were modestly increased (from 0 to 17%) through mild scarification in the absence of stratification. Results indicate that beach vitex has physical (fruit coat) and physiological (seed) dormancy mechanisms that are capable of delaying germination for multiple seasons, allowing development of a soil seed bank. Beach vitex can reestablish from seed after vegetation removal.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1939-7291			WOS:000291707600016

Since its introduction in the 1980s, this Pacific Rim native has invaded many fragile beach-dune ecosystems along the Mid-Atlantic, Southern Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico. Large-scale monocultures of beach vitex supplant native species through rapid vegetative reproduction and seed production. Fruits are capable of water-based dispersal, allowing for potential rapid range expansion in coastal areas. Ecosystem damage resulting from exclusion of native plant species by beach vitex and fears associated with potential negative effects on sea turtle nesting have served to promote the control and survey efforts presently underway in coastal areas of the Carolinas, Virginia, and Maryland.									6	0	0	4	0	6			1939-7291			WOS:000291707600018

It has long been accepted that particles move parallel to the applied electric field in a straight uniform microchannel. This paper presents the first experimental demonstration of lateral particle migration in electrophoresis through a rectangular microchannel. This wall-induced dielectrophoresis-resembled motion is driven by the electrical force arising from the non-uniform electric field around the particle. It decays rapidly when the particle is away from the channel wall, and vanishes in the center of the channel. The observed result is a focused particle stream flowing along the channel centerline.

The size of the device and associated increase in viscous dissipation constitute another constraint. In response to these limitations, this work proposes and demonstrates the manipulation of light by adding a functional lens to control the light on demand. In the present work, this lens is realized by filling a hollow fiber with a colloid of superparamagnetic Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles. When the propagation of light is perpendicular to the magnetic field, this lens stretches the circular beam into a ribbon yielding a larger visible area. Potentially, one can apply a rotating magnetic field thus illuminating a larger spot size or creating other beam geometries. Such composite fibers might also be of value for Faraday isolation and other magneto-optic effects in optical fibers.

Modeling of AA5083 Material-Microstructure Evolution During Butt Friction-Stir Welding								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				19	5			672	684		10.1007/s11665-009-9536-1			JUL 2010	2010	A concise yet a fairly comprehensive overview of the friction stir welding (FSW) process is provided. This is followed by a computational investigation in which FSW behavior of a prototypical solution-strengthened and strain-hardened aluminum alloy, AA5083-H131, is modeled using a fully coupled thermo-mechanical finite-element procedure developed in our prior study. Particular attention is given to proper modeling of the welding work-piece material behavior during the FSW process. Specifically, competition and interactions between plastic-deformation and dynamic-recrystallization processes are considered to properly account for the material-microstructure evolution in the weld nugget zone. The results showed that with proper modeling of the material behavior under high-temperature/severe-plastic-deformation conditions, significantly improved agreement can be attained between the computed and measured post-FSW residual-stress and material-strength distribution results.									36	2	0	0	1	36			1059-9495			WOS:000280240900011		
J	Zeng, Fan; Ayalew, Beshah								Estimation and coordinated control for distributed parameter processes with a moving radiant actuator								JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL				20	6			743	753		10.1016/j.jprocont.2010.04.005			JUL 2010	2010	This paper presents an estimation and control scheme for a class of industrial processes described by distributed parameter models with a moving radiant actuator. To overcome the lack of direct sensing alternatives for process state, a dual extended Kalman filter is established for estimating process status online based on a reduced process model and available output measurements. A distinct challenge that is addressed is the selection and construction of a suitable feedback signal from the distributed state estimate following the moving radiant actuator. The estimated status is then integrated into a rule-based feedback controller, which coordinates two manipulated variables of the moving radiant actuator to achieve the control objective. The two manipulated variables are the velocity and the radiant flux or power of the moving actuator. Both the estimation and feedback control strategies are demonstrated using computer simulations of one-dimensional distributed parameter models for an ultraviolet (UV) coating curing process involving a moving UV source. The results show that the proposed estimation and control schemes can significantly improve process quality and compensate for unknown disturbances on the target. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Density estimation using asymmetric kernels and Bayes bandwidths with censored data								JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE				140	7			1765	1774		10.1016/j.jspi.2010.01.001			JUL 2010	2010	We propose a modification to the regular kernel density estimation method that use asymmetric kernels to circumvent the spill over problem for densities with positive support. First a pivoting method is introduced for placement of the data relative to the kernel function. This yields a strongly consistent density estimator that integrates to one for each fixed bandwidth in contrast to most density estimators based on asymmetric kernels proposed in the literature. Then a data-driven Bayesian local bandwidth selection method is presented and lognormal, gamma, Weibull and inverse Gaussian kernels are discussed as useful special cases. Simulation results and a real-data example illustrate the advantages of the new methodology. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0378-3758			WOS:000276369000014

Simplified Direct Displacement Design of Six-Story Woodframe Building and Pretest Seismic Performance Assessment								JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING-ASCE				136	7			813	825		10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000181			JUL 2010	2010	This paper presents a simplified direct displacement design (DDD) procedure which was used to design the shear walls for a six-story woodframe structure. The building was tested in the final phase of a Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) project. Specifically, NEESWood Capstone Building was designed to meet four performance expectations: damage limitation, life safety, far-field collapse prevention (CP), and near-fault CP. The performance expectations are defined in terms of combinations of interstory drift limits and prescribed seismic hazard levels associated with predefined nonexceedance probabilities. To verify that design requirements were met, a series of nonlinear time-history analyses (NLTHAs) was performed using suits of both far-field and near-fault ground motion records. The distributions of interstory drifts obtained from the NLTHA confirm that the Capstone Building designed using DDD meets all four target performance expectations, thereby validating the DDD procedure. Additionally, collapse analysis in accordance with the recently proposed Applied Technology Council project 63 (ATC-63) methodology was performed. The results of incremental dynamic analyses confirmed that the Capstone Building designed using the DDD procedure has adequate capacity margin against collapse, as dictated by the ATC-63 methodology.									34	1	0	0	0	35			0733-9445			WOS:000278907500006

Distributed fault tolerant computation of weakly connected dominating set in ad hoc networks								JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING				53	1	SI		182	195		10.1007/s11227-009-0325-2			JUL 2010	2010	Our purpose in this paper is to propose a self-stabilizing protocol for weakly connected dominating set (WCDS) set in a given ad hoc network graph. WCDS is a particular variant of graph domination predicates which play an important role in routing in ad hoc networks. There are many variants of domination problems in bidirectional networks; WCDS is also useful in forming clusters in ad hoc networks. There are many heuristic and distributed algorithms to compute WCDS in network graphs while almost all of them will need complete information about the network topology and most of them are not fault tolerant or mobility tolerant. Self-stabilization is a protocol design paradigm that is especially useful in resource constrained infrastructure-less networks since nodes can make moves based on local knowledge only and yet a global task is accomplished in a fault tolerant manner; it also facilitates for nodes to enter and exit the network freely. There exist self-stabilizing protocols for minimal spanning tree, total domination, and others. We have shown that the paradigm is capable of designing a protocol for WCDS. Our objective is to mathematically prove the correctness and the convergence of the protocol in any worst-case scenario, as is usually done for self-stabilizing protocols for other graph predicates used for ad hoc networks.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0920-8542			WOS:000278527000011

Two different retort pouch structures were used: the organic material coated retort pouch (ORG), organic material coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/biaxially oriented nylon (BON)/cast polypropylene (CPP); the inorganic material coated retort pouch (IND), aluminum oxide coated PET/BON/CPP. Two specific cooked rice products, plain and chicken-flavored cooked rice, were utilized for the comparison. For quantitative analysis, moisture content and lightness of the rice products were measured. The moisture content of both the plain and chicken-flavored rice packed in either pouch decreased slightly during the 12 week storage time after retort processing. However, there were no significant differences in quantitative analysis between the ORG and IND for both the plain and chicken-flavored cooked rice. A simple paired comparison test was used to evaluate the sensory characteristics of rice products. Overall, there were no significant sensory differences between the ORG and IND for both the plain and the chicken-flavored cooked rice. These results demonstrated that the newly developed ORG can be used as a retort pouch material for RTE rice products. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The antimicrobial effectiveness was tested with three pathogenic bacteria, specifically Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia colt and Salmonella enteritidis. Also, these chitosan incorporated films were applied on red meat surfaces to determine the effectiveness of chitosan on color shelf life extension and microbial growth inhibition. Chitosan was exposed to 0.1% peptone water containing the three pathogens in separate tests and inhibited microbial growth a higher levels with increasing concentration of chitosan in the film matrix. Oxygen permeability was not affected by the incorporation of chitosan, while the water vapor permeability increased with the addition of chitosan. Film elongation decreased with the addition of chitosan. When chitosan incorporated films were applied on fresh red meat, microorganisms on the meat surface were not inhibited but significant extension of red color shelf life were observed in refrigerated, sliced red meats.

The various particle focusing approaches in microfluidic devices may be conveniently classified as sheath flow focusing and sheathless focusing. Sheath flow focusers use one or more sheath fluids to pinch the particle suspension and thus focus the suspended particles. Sheathless focusers typically rely on a force to manipulate particles laterally to their equilibrium positions. This force can be either externally applied or internally induced by channel topology. Therefore, the sheathless particle focusing methods may be further classified as active or passive by the nature of the forces involved. The aim of this article is to introduce and discuss the recent developments in both sheath flow and sheathless particle focusing approaches in microfluidic devices.									147	2	0	54	1	147			1613-4982			WOS:000278526300001

Acute tryptophan depletion increases experimental nausea but also induces hunger in healthy female subjects								NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY				22	7						10.1111/j.1365-2982.2010.01527.x			JUL 2010	2010	BackgroundAcute tryptophan depletion (ATD) is an experimental model to reduce central serotonin levels.MethodsThirty-eight healthy female subjects were randomly assigned to two groups (ATD and control) in a randomized, double-blinded parallel-group design. Following a standardized and balanced amino acid diet (including 1.21 g tryptophan) on the first day, they received either a protein drink without tryptophan (but substituted by other amino acids) (ATD condition) or the balanced protein drink with tryptophan (control condition) 24 h later. Four hours after its consumption, they were exposed to a standard rotation procedure. Symptom ratings (SR), ratings of hunger and mood scores were taken prior to rotation, at each break, and 15 and 30 min thereafter, together with saliva cortisol samples.Key ResultsFive subjects could not tolerate the entire rotation procedure and were excluded from analysis. For the remaining n = 33, SR and hunger ratings were higher during ATD than during control conditions, but mood was unaffected. Cortisol levels rose significantly with rotation but were unaffected by ATD. High baseline cortisol levels were associated with lower SR during rotation. The protective effects of morning cortisol were pronounced during the menstrual and follicular phase of the cycle and not present during ovulation and the luteal phase.Conclusions & InferencesAcute tryptophan depletion is associated with increased symptoms of nausea in healthy female subjects when exposed to body rotation. Acute tryptophan depletion also increases hunger rating. These opposite effects may indicate independent actions of the serotonin on central and peripheral functions.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1350-1925			WOS:000278525200006	20553564

COMSET						On crystallographic orientation in crystal core optical fibers								OPTICAL MATERIALS				32	9			862	867		10.1016/j.optmat.2010.01.002			JUL 2010	2010	Recently developed glass-clad semiconductor core optical fibers offer potential advantages over present optical fiber materials, including greatly enhanced Raman cross-sections and extended infrared transparency. While fibers have been fabricated that exhibit a high degree of crystallinity there has not been any in-depth analysis of the nature of the crystallographic orientation of the core material relative to the fiber axes. This crystallographic analysis is of important scientific and technological value since optical fiber fabrication is a highly non-equilibrium process; consequently, achieving high degrees of crystallinity is counter-intuitive. In this work, the crystallographic orientation of germanium core optical fibers was analyzed using single crystal X-ray diffraction and electron backscatter diffraction techniques. Over nearly a 100 mm length of fiber the Ge cores were found to be polycrystalline with the (100) and (110) orientations dominant implying a dendritic growth mechanism. Single crystal regions were observed routinely in lengths greater than 8 mm with the longest being about 15 mm. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The authors demonstrate that CMV can either inflate or deflate bivariate linear relationships, depending on the degree of symmetry with which CMV affects the observed measures. With respect to multivariate linear relationships, they show that common method bias generally decreases when additional independent variables suffering from CMV are included in a regression equation. Finally, they demonstrate that quadratic and interaction effects cannot be artifacts of CMV. On the contrary, both quadratic and interaction terms can be severely deflated through CMV, making them more difficult to detect through statistical means.									429	5	0	6	2	435			1094-4281			WOS:000278977000005

Therefore, ECM fibers are an important component in tissue and organ development and regeneration. Meanwhile, polymer nanofibers could play the same critical role in tissue regeneration process. Fibrous structures can be fabricated from a variety of materials and methods with diameters ranging throughout the size scale where cells can sense individual fibers (several nanometers to several microns). Polymer nanofiber scaffolds can be designed in a way that predictably modulates a variety of important cell behaviors towards a desired overall function. The nanofibrous topography itself, independent of the fiber material, has demonstrated the potential to modulate cell behaviors desirable in tissue engineering such as: unidirectional alignment; increased viability, attachment, and ECM production; guided migration; and controlled differentiation. The versatility of polymer nanofibers for functionalization with biomolecules opens the door to vast opportunities for the design of tissue engineering scaffolds with even greater control over cell incorporation and function. Despite the promise of polymer nanofibers as tissue engineering scaffolds there have been few clinically relevant successes because no single fabrication technique currently combines control over structural arrangement, material composition, and biofunctionalization, while maintaining reasonable cost and yield. Promising strategies are currently being investigated to allow for the fabrication of optimal polymer nanofiber tissue engineering scaffolds with the goal of treating damaged and degenerated tissues in a clinical setting.

Fe I and Fe II Abundances of Solar-Type Dwarfs in the Pleiades Open Cluster								PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC				122	893			766	777					JUL 2010	2010	We have derived Fe abundances of 16 solar-type Pleiades dwarfs by means of an equivalent-width analysis of Fe I and Fe II lines in high-resolution spectra obtained with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope and High Resolution Spectrograph. Abundances derived from Fe II lines are larger than those derived from Fe I lines (herein referred to as overionization) for stars with T(eff) < 5400 K, and the discrepancy (Delta Fe = [Fe II/H]-[FeI/H]) increases dramatically with decreasing T(eff), reaching over 0.8 dex for the coolest stars of our sample. The Pleiades joins the open clusters M 34, the Hyades, IC 2602, and IC 2391, and the Ursa Major moving group, demonstrating ostensible overionization trends. The Pleiades Delta Fe abundances are correlated with Ca II infrared triplet and H alpha chromospheric emission indicators and relative differences therein. Oxygen abundances of our Pleiades sample derived from the high-excitation O I triplet have been previously shown to increase with decreasing T(eff), and a comparison with the Delta Fe abundances suggests that the overexcitation (larger abundances derived from high-excitation lines relative to low-excitation lines) and overionization effects that have been observed in cool open cluster and disk field main-sequence (MS) dwarfs share a common origin. Curiously, a correlation between the Pleiades O I abundances and chromospheric emission indicators does not exist. Star-to-star Fe I abundances have low internal scatter (< 0: 11 dex), but the abundances of stars with T(ef)f < 5400 K are systematically higher compared to the warmer stars. The cool star [Fe I/H] abundances cannot be connected directly to overexcitation effects, but similarities with the Delta Fe and O I triplet trends suggest the abundances are dubious. Using the [FeI/H] abundances of five stars with T(eff) > 5400 K, we derive a mean Pleiades cluster metallicity of [Fe/H] = +0.01 +/- 0.02.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0004-6280			WOS:000279112700003

The setup includes a high speed, ultra sensitive infrared focal plane array and in-house developed pre and post-processing codes. The pre-processing neutralizes the emittance variation with the cage geometry using new mapping scheme, while the post-processor creates spatial neighbourhoods to average the stress signal and reduce the detector and the environment noise; also the algorithm checks for the adiabatic conditions through the synchronicity between the load cyclic frequency and that of the temperature differentials. The thermo-elastic investigation is done at different loadings from 20 - 140 Lbf at a frequency of 10 Hz, in two modes: a calibration mode with the weld-seam located at 9 o'clock position and a detailed mode with the weld-seam at 6 o'clock location. A Finite Element FE simulation is used to adjust the thermo-elastic constant using the calibration trials (weld at 9 o'clock). The detailed trials (weld at 6 o'clock) are then compared with the FE simulation, showing good agreement in predicting the stress values and maps. The proposed hardware and software map the stresses 3 dimensional for the weld region with a 25 MPa resolution, in real-time and is found to resolve stress changes for each 20 Lbf loading.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1768-6733			WOS:000286025200001

Whites and females were more likely to be prosecuted than Blacks and males, particularly for less serious offenses. At first and second referrals, Blacks were more likely to be incarcerated than Whites. Youth referred before age 14 were more likely to recidivate and youth prosecuted for earlier offenses were more likely to recidivate than those not prosecuted. Father absence and special education status were also predictive of recidivism. Prosecution for first referral was predictive of earlier reoffending at all severity levels of first offense.									21	0	0	0	0	21			0741-9325			WOS:000279847000005

An Investigation of the mechanistic pathways in hydrolysis and transesterification were carried out at a relatively high temperature (100-130 A degrees C) and moderate pressures (120-180 psi) with tricaprylin and water for hydrolysis or methanol for transesterification using a tungstated zirconia catalyst in a batch reactor. It was found that upon increasing the concentration of TCp, the reaction rates for both hydrolysis and transesterification increased at all conditions. In contrast, water inhibited the reaction rate of hydrolysis by poisoning the active sites. For transesterification, the apparent reaction order of methanol evolved from positive to negative as the concentration of methanol relative to TCp increased. Using a reaction model discrimination procedure, it was found that hydrolysis on WZ could be successfully described by an Eley-Rideal single site mechanism with adsorbed TCp reacting with bulk phase water. The mechanistic pathway for transesterification also seems to follow a similar mechanism, identical to the one previously proposed for transesterification on a solid acid catalyst (SiO(2)-supported Nafion-SAC-13) at lower temperature (60 A degrees C).									6	1	0	0	0	7			1022-5528			WOS:000278159600009

EVALUATING SIMPLE, LOW-COST TECHNIQUES TO ESTIMATE MOLECULAR WEIGHTS AND CHARGE DENSITIES OF POLYDISPERSE COMMERCIAL POLYACRYLAMIDES FOR SOIL AND SEDIMENT APPLICATIONS								TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE				53	4			1127	1136					JUL-AUG 2010	2010	Nonionic and anionic polyacrylamides (PAMs) are being used more extensively in soil erosion prevention and sediment control applications. Of their various physicochemical properties, the molecular weight (MW) and charge density (CD) of PAMs have been reported as being the most important characteristics for soil stabilization and sediment flocculation. However, these properties rarely have been measured by researchers or practitioners in the fields of soil and environmental sciences, presumably due to the difficulty of the measurements or lack of access to proper equipment. The objective of this research was to demonstrate the applicability of two relatively simple, low-cost approaches for estimating CDs and MWs of polydisperse, commercially available PAMs. Values obtained with the simple measurement techniques (acid-base titration for CD, viscosity determination for MW) were compared to those measured using sophisticated state-of-the-science techniques (carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen (CHN) elemental analysis for CD, multi-angle laser light scattering for MW). Measured CD and MW values were also compared to the values provided by PAM vendors when available. Results from the simple titration method were in excellent agreement with the more complicated CHN analysis for CD values, with differences never more than +/-8%. In contrast, values provided by vendors had deviations in CDs ranging from -30% to +17% from measured CHN values and were never closer than 7% absolute difference. Replicate measurements resulted in a coefficient of variation in CD values ranging from 2% to 15% using the CHN technique, but only a 0.2% to 3% coefficient of variation with the simple titration method. Molecular weights estimated from the simple viscosity technique were lower than those obtained from. multi-angle laser light scattering, a factor that reflected the viscosity- versus weight-average MWs of our polydisperse commercial PAM samples. Because quantitative MW information often may not be provided by vendors, as well as the fact that common application practices may lead to shear forces that reduce the MW, we believe viscosity-based MW values should be satisfactory for most users of commercial PAM products. Additional simplifications and modifications that we suggest in this article will make both the titration and viscosity techniques useful for a wide variety of PAM users, particularly those who do not have access to sophisticated analytical laboratories but yet have the need to maintain adequate quality assurance and control in their soil erosion prevention and sediment control applications.									3	0	0	1	0	3			2151-0032	2151-0040		WOS:000282197700010

Development of therapeutic agents with the ability to attenuate both the duration and severity of disease in patients after infection is particularly desirable in dengue endemic resource-poor settings. The reliance of dengue virus on endogenous processes during the late stages of infection prompts the development of molecules to interfere with and exploit these dependencies as potential antiviral therapies. Here we focus on the importance of N-linked glycan processing in infectious virion morphogenesis.									22	1	0	21	1	24			0966-842X			WOS:000280054200006	20452219

Energy harvesting under excitations of time-varying frequency								JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION				329	13			2497	2515		10.1016/j.jsv.2010.01.015			JUN 21 2010	2010	The design and optimization of energy harvesters capable of scavenging energy efficiently from realistic environments require a deep understanding of their transduction under non-stationary and random excitations. Otherwise, their small energy outputs can be further decreased lowering their efficiency and rendering many critical and possibly life saving technologies inefficient. As a first step towards this critical understanding, this effort investigates the response of energy harvesters to harmonic excitations of time-varying frequency. Such excitations can be used to represent the behavior of realistic vibratory environments whose frequency varies or drifts with time. Specifically, we consider a piezoelectric stack-type harvester subjected to a harmonic excitation of constant amplitude and a sinusoidally varying frequency. We analyze the response of the harvester in the fixed-frequency scenario then use the Jacobi-Anger's expansion to analyze the response in the time-varying case. We obtain analytical expressions for the harvester's response, output voltage, and power. In-depth analysis of the attained results reveals that the solution to the more complex time-varying frequency can be understood through a process which "samples" the fixed-frequency response curve at a discrete and fixed frequency interval then multiplies the response by proper weights. Extensive discussions addressing the effect of the excitation parameters on the output power is presented leading to some initial suggestions pertinent to the harvester's design and optimization in the sinusoidally varying frequency case.

J	Fedkin, A. V.; Meyer, B. S.; Grossman, L.								Condensation and mixing in supernova ejecta								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				74	12			3642	3658		10.1016/j.gca.2010.03.021			JUN 15 2010	2010	Low-density graphite spherules from the Murchison carbonaceous chondrite contain TIC grains and possess excess (28)Si and (44)Ca (from decay of short-lived (44)Ti). These and other isotopic anomalies indicate that such grains formed by condensation from mixtures of ejecta from the interior of a core-collapse supernova with those from the exterior. Using homogenized chemical and isotopic model compositions of the eight main burning zones as end-members, Travaglio et al. (1999) attempted to find mixtures whose isotopic compositions match those observed in the graphite spherules, subject to the condition that the atomic C/O ratio = 1. They were partially successful, but this chemical condition does not guarantee condensation of TiC at a higher temperature than graphite, which is indicated by the spherule textures. In the present work, model compositions of relatively thin layers of ejecta within the main burning zones computed by Rauscher et al. (2002) for Type II supernovae of 15, 21 and 25 M(circle dot) are used to construct mixtures whose chemical compositions cause equilibrium condensation of TiC at a higher temperature than graphite in an attempt to match the textures and isotopic compositions of the spherules simultaneously. The variation of pressure with temperature and the change in elemental abundances with time due to radioactive decay were taken into account in the condensation calculations. Layers were found within the main Ni, O/Ne, He/C and He/N zones that, when mixed together, simultaneously match the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions, (44)Ti/(48)Ti ratios and inferred initial (26)Al/(27)Al ratios of the low-density graphite spherules, even at subsolar (12)C/(13)C ratios. Due to the relatively large proportion of material from the Ni zone and the relative amounts of the two layers of the Ni zone required to meet these conditions, predicted (28)Si excesses are larger than observed in the low-density graphite spherules, and large negative delta(46)Ti/(48)Ti, delta(47)Ti/(48)Ti, delta(49)Ti/(48)Ti and delta(50)Ti/(48)Ti are produced, in contrast to the observed normal delta(46)Ti/(48)Ti and delta(47)Ti/(48)Ti, large positive delta(49)Ti/(48)Ti and smaller positive delta(50)Ti/(48)Ti. Although better matches to the observed delta(46)Ti/(48)Ti, delta(47)Ti/(48)Ti and (28)Si excesses can be found using much smaller amounts of Ni zone material and some Si/S zone material, it is very difficult to match simultaneously the Ti and Si isotopic compositions in any mixtures of material from these deep layers with He/C and He/N zone material, regardless of the condensation sequence. The occurrence of Fe-rich, Si-poor metal grains inside the graphite spherules does not have a satisfactory explanation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent results at 230 degrees C and 1.8 bar have shown 21% ethanol selectivity for the doubly promoted Rh-La/V/SiO2. Here, we extend this work to examine the effects of reaction conditions - temperature, H-2/CO ratio, space velocity, and pressure - on the activity and selectivity of these catalysts. An ethanol selectivity of 51.8% (close to the highest literature value) at a CO conversion of 7.9% was achieved with a corresponding methane selectivity of 15.4% at 270 degrees C, 14 bar and H-2/CO = 2 over the Rh-La/V/SiO2 catalyst. Combined La/V promotion reduces methane selectivity and increases C2+ oxygenates selectivity compared to the singly promoted catalysts by increasing the rate of CO insertion. Contrary to literature studies, higher pressures led to a dramatic increase in methane selectivity at the expense of ethanol, indicating increased CO dissociation activity at higher pressures, leaving fewer active CO molecules for insertion. The chain growth factor (alpha) for higher oxygenates differed significantly from that for hydrocarbons, suggesting that formation of these two types of products either proceeds by different mechanisms or on different active sites.

Screening-level ecological and human health risk assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in stormwater detention pond sediments of Coastal South Carolina, USA								JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS				178	1-3			906	916		10.1016/j.jhazmat.2010.02.024			JUN 15 2010	2010	Screening-level ecological and human health assessments were performed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contamination in the sediments of 19 stormwater detention ponds located in coastal South Carolina. For ecological screening benchmarks, we used threshold and probable effect concentrations (TEC and PEC) derived from consensus-based sediment quality guidelines for individual PAH analytes and equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmarks-toxic units (Sigma ESB-TU) derived for PAH mixtures. For human health benchmarks, we used preliminary remediation goals (PRGs). Sediments of five stormwater ponds (four commercial ponds and one residential pond with a large drainage area) exceeded PEC values for several PAH analytes and the Sigma ESB-TU safe value of 1 for PAH mixtures. These same five stormwater ponds also exceeded the PRG values for five carcinogenic PAH analytes. These results suggest that the PAH levels in sediments from certain commercial and residential ponds have the potential to pose moderate to high risks for adverse, chronic effects to benthic organisms in situ and an increased risk of cancer to humans ex situ following excavation and on-site disposal. We recommend that sediment from these stormwater ponds be tested prior to excavation to determine the appropriate method of disposal. We also recommend that regulatory agencies enforce guidelines for periodic sediment removal as this should reduce both in situ and ex situ risks resulting from sediment PAH exposure.

The buoyancy-driven displacement ventilation model of Linden et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 212, 1990, p. 309) predicts the formation of a two-layer stratification when a single plume is introduced into an enclosure with vents at the top and bottom. The model assumes that diffusion plays no role in the development of the ambient buoyancy stratification: diffusion is a slow process and the entrainment of ambient fluid into the plume from the diffuse interface will act to thin the interface resulting in a near discontinuity of density between the upper and lower layers. This prediction has been corroborated by small-scale salt bath experiments; however, full-scale measurements in ventilated rooms and complementary numerical simulations suggest an interface that is not sharp but rather smeared out over a finite thickness. For a given plume buoyancy flux, as the cross-sectional area of the enclosure increases the volume of fluid that must be entrained by the plume to maintain a sharp interface also increases. Therefore the balance between the diffusive thickening of the interface and plume-driven thinning favours a thicker interface. Conversely, the interface thickness decreases with increasing source buoyancy flux, although the dependence is relatively weak. Our analysis presents two models for predicting the interface thickness as a function of the enclosure height, base area, composite vent area, plume buoyancy flux and buoyancy diffusivity. Model results are compared with interface thickness measurements based on previously reported data. Positive qualitative and quantitative agreement is observed.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0022-1120			WOS:000279016200009

Sixteen species of Culicoides were collected, four of which represented more than 80%. They were Culicoides guttipennis (Coquillett), Culicoides mulrenanni Beck, Culicoides obsoletus (Meigen), and Culicoides sanguisuga (Coquillett). C. guttipennis was found on a dead colobus monkey and a dead golden-headed lion tamarin; Culicoides husseyi Wirth & Blanton was collected from an unidentified, abandoned bird's nest. Ultraviolet light-equipped traps captured significantly more Culicoides specimens than traps with incandescent light. Half of the collected species previously have been associated with vertebrate pathogens, indicating a potential risk to captive animals.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1536-2442			WOS:000278539800001	20569132

In this work, two commercially available echinacea ethanolic extracts were used as the test samples for the separation, identification, and quantification of the caffeic acid derivatives (caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, cichoric acid, and caftaric acid), which are suggested to have beneficial medicinal properties. Detailed evaluations of the two primary controlling parameters for EI (electron energy and source block temperature) and GD (discharge current and pressure) sources were performed to determine optimal instrument operation conditions. The mass spectra obtained from both ion sources provide clear and simple molecular fragmentation patterns for each of the target analytes. The absolute detection limits for the caffeic acid derivatives were determined to be at subnanogram levels for both the EI and GD sources. The separation of the caffeic acid derivatives in echinacea was accomplished by reversed-phase chromatography using a C(18) column and a gradient elution system of water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and methanol, with an analysis time of less than 40 min. A standard addition method was employed for the quantification of each of the caffeic acid derivatives in the tincture.									14	0	0	10	0	14			1618-2642			WOS:000277593200035	20349350

Girls completed the G-DAS and the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale and wore an accelerometer for 7 days.Results Results supported a five-factor solution for the GDAS; factors represented reasons for disliking PA including low perceived competence, lack of opportunities, high perceived exertion, concern about physical appearance, and threats to girls' gender identity. Data supported the reliability and validity of the G-DAS. Low perceived competence was the most common reason girls reported disliking PA and predicted a decreased likelihood of maintaining sufficient PA across ages 13 to 15 years.Conclusion Developing PA-related skills prior to adolescence may reduce declines in adolescent girls' PA.									14	0	0	1	0	14			0883-6612			WOS:000282082000008	20393818

Fermi can measure the spectral properties of gamma-ray bursts over a very large energy range and is opening a new window on the prompt emission of these energetic events. Localizations by the instruments on Fermi in combination with follow-up by Swift provide accurate positions for observations at longer wavelengths leading to the determination of redshifts, the true energy budget, host galaxy properties and facilitate comparison with pre-Fermi bursts.Methods. Multi-wavelength follow-up observations were performed on the afterglows of four bursts with high energy emission detected by Fermi/LAT: GRB090323, GRB090328, GRB090510 and GRB090902B. They were obtained in the optical/near-infrared bands with GROND mounted at the MPG/ESO 2.2 m telescope and additionally of GRB090323 in the optical with the 2 m telescope in Tautenburg, Germany. Three of the events are classified as long bursts while GRB090510 is a well localized short GRB with GeV emission. In addition, host galaxies were detected for three of the four bursts. Spectroscopic follow-up was initiated with the VLT for GRB090328 and GRB090510.Results. The afterglow observations in 7 bands are presented for all bursts and their host galaxies are investigated. Knowledge of the distance and the local dust extinction enables comparison of the afterglows of LAT-detected GRBs with the general sample. The spectroscopic redshifts of GRB090328 and GRB090510 were determined to be z = 0.7354 +/- 0.0003 and z = 0.903 +/- 0.001 and dust corrected star-formation rates of 4.8 M-circle dot yr(-1) and 0.60 M-circle dot yr(-1) were derived for their host galaxies, respectively.Conclusions. The afterglows of long bursts exhibit power-law decay indices (alpha) from less than 1 to similar to 2.3 and spectral indices (beta(opt)) values from 0.65 to similar to 1.2 which are fairly standard for GRB afterglows. Constraints are placed on the jet half opening angles of less than or similar to 2.1 degrees. to greater than or similar to 6.4 degrees, which allows limits to be placed on the beaming corrected energies. These range from less than or similar to 5 x 10(50) erg to the one of the highest values ever recorded, greater than or similar to 2.2 x 10(52) erg for GRB 090902B, and are not consistent with a standard candle. The extremely energetic long Fermi bursts have optical afterglows which lie in the top half of the brightness distribution of all optical afterglows detected in the Swift era or even in the top 5% if incompleteness is considered. The properties of the host galaxies of these LAT detected bursts in terms of extinction, star formation rates and masses do not appear to differ from previous samples.									54	1	0	0	0	55			1432-0746			WOS:000280275400086

These observations were performed for the purpose of constraining the physical characteristics of the interstellar material along each line of sight. Toward MWC 1080, we detected strong CO absorption and determined a column density upper limit of 1.4 x 10(14) cm(-2) for H-3(+). We infer that there is very little diffuse material along the line of sight toward MWC 1080 and that the CO absorption is consistent with an origin in the dispersing natal cloud. We detected both cold CO and H-3(+) toward MWC 349, consistent with a diffuse cloud origin. Similarly, both CO and H-3(+) were detected toward LkH alpha 101. Using a recently revised value for the cosmic ray ionization rate, we conclude that the CO absorption is consistent with a dense cloud origin while the H-3(+) could originate in either the dense or diffuse interstellar medium. We also find no evidence for CO fractionation toward LkH alpha 101 as reported by Goto et al.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0004-637X			WOS:000277642100004

The statistical literature has focused mainly on estimating the index coefficients, the mean function, and their asymptotic properties. For accurate statistical inference it is equally important to estimate the error variance of these models. We examine two estimators of the error variance in a single-index model and compare them with a few competing estimators with respect to their corresponding asymptotic properties. Using a simulation study, we evaluate the finite-sample performance of our estimators against their competitors.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1369-1473			WOS:000278074300005

However, a recent report identified a number of synthetic additives in samples of 'Spice'. One of these, the indole derivative JWH018, is a ligand for the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) cannabinoid receptor and inhibits cAMP production in CB1 receptor-expressing CHO cells. Other effects of JWH018 on CB1 receptor-mediated signalling are not known, particularly in neurons. Here we have evaluated the signalling pathways activated by JWH018 at CB1 receptors.Experimental approach:We investigated the effects of JWH018 on neurotransmission in cultured autaptic hippocampal neurons. We further analysed its activation of ERK1/2 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and internalization of CB1 receptors in HEK293 cells stably expressing this receptor.Key results:In cultured autaptic hippocampal neurons, JWH018 potently inhibited excitatory postsynaptic currents (IC50 = 14.9 nM) in a concentration- and CB1 receptor-dependent manner. Furthermore, it increased ERK1/2 MAPK phosphorylation (EC50 = 4.4 nM). We also found that JWH018 potently induced rapid and robust CB1 receptor internalization (EC50 = 2.8 nM; t(1/2) = 17.3 min).Conclusions and implications:JWH018, a prominent component of several herbal preparations marketed for their psychoactivity, is a potent and effective CB1 receptor agonist that activates multiple CB1 receptor signalling pathways. Thus, it is likely that the subjective effects of 'Spice' are due to activation of cannabinoid CB1 receptors by JWH018, added to this herbal preparation.									106	0	0	74	0	108			0007-1188			WOS:000277914700015	20100276

Engagement in voting predicted voting in the presidential election and magnified positive feelings of voting for the winning candidate. Test engagement predicted performance on the test, and magnified positive feelings of not showing a discrepancy between expected and actual test performance. Engagement in personal projects interacted with task complexity to predict project completion, with engagement being related to goal completion for tasks high in complexity. Project engagement also magnified the positive effects of a high probability of completing the project. The results provide support for task engagement as a predictor of performance and as a facilitator of positive feelings following success.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0144-6665			WOS:000278017000002	19426582

Bulletin of the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory				49				13	16					June 2010	2010	We propose that important features of cardiac function may be clarified by charting the electrical and mechanical properties of cardiac tissues from an evolutionary sequence that includes tunicates, hagfish, lamprey, elasmobranchs, amphibians, and mammals. Here we have examined the heart of the hagfish, which has descended from one of the earliest offspring diverging from our vertebrate lineage. We found specialized atrial and ventricular tissues, as well as unexpected responses of a type that in higher vertebrates are contingent on autonomic innervations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0097-0883			ZOOREC:ZOOR14701003670

J	Sierad, Leslie Neil; Simionescu, Agneta; Albers, Christopher; Chen, Joseph; Maivelett, Jordan; Tedder, Mary Elizabeth; Liao, Jun; Simionescu, Dan T								Design and Testing of a Pulsatile Conditioning System for Dynamic Endothelialization of Polyphenol-Stabilized Tissue Engineered Heart Valves.								Cardiovascular engineering and technology				1	2			138	153					2010-Jun	2010	Heart valve tissue engineering requires biocompatible and hemocompatible scaffolds that undergo remodeling and repopulation, but that also withstand harsh mechanical forces immediately following implantation. We hypothesized that reversibly stabilized acellular porcine valves, seeded with endothelial cells and conditioned in pulsatile bioreactors would pave the way for next generations of tissue engineered heart valves (TEHVs). A novel valve conditioning system was first designed, manufactured and tested to adequately assess TEHVs. The bioreactor created proper closing and opening of valves and allowed for multiple mounting methods in sterile conditions. Porcine aortic heart valve roots were decellularized by chemical extractions and treated with penta-galloyl glucose (PGG) for stabilization. Properties of the novel scaffolds were evaluated by testing resistance to collagenase and elastase, biaxial mechanical analysis, and thermal denaturation profiles. Porcine aortic endothelial cells were seeded onto the leaflets and whole aortic roots were mounted within the dynamic pulsatile heart valve bioreactor system under physiologic pulmonary valve pressures and analyzed after 17 days for cell viability, morphology, and metabolic activity. Our tissue preparation methods effectively removed cells, including the potent alpha-Gal antigen, while leaving a well preserved extra-cellular matrix scaffold with adequate mechanical properties. PGG enhanced stabilization of extracellular matrix components but also showed the ability to be reversible. Engineered valve scaffolds encouraged attachment and survival of endothelial cells for extended periods and showed signs of widespread cell coverage after conditioning. Our novel approach shows promise toward development of sturdy and durable TEHVs capable of remodeling and cellular repopulation.									26	0	0	16	0	26				1869-4098		MEDLINE:21340043	21340043	
J	Tompkins, Robert D.; Luckenbaugh, Catherine M.; Stringer, William C.; Richardson, Keith H.; Mikhailova, Elena A.; Bridges, William C., Jr.								Suther Prairie: Vascular Flora, Species Richness, and Edaphic Factors								CASTANEA				75	2			232	244		10.2179/09-041.1			JUN 2010	2010	Piedmont prairie communities of the southeastern United States were common prior to European settlement. Suther Prairie in Cabarrus County, North Carolina is among the best-known examples of such an ecosystem. This study provides a complete floristic list of species observed at the site from 1997-2007. Sampling over the 10 yr period included fixed transects and general floristic inventories. During the 2006-07 growing seasons, additional transects and 90 randomly placed 1 m(2) quadrats were established for sampling species frequency. Soil in six of these random quadrats was sampled at three depths (0-10 cm, 11-20 cm, 21-30 cm) for pH, organic C, total N, and extractable P, K, Ca, Mg, Zn, Mn, Cu, B, and Na.There were 208 species documented during the 10 yr sampling period. In 2006-07 142 new species were identified, but 49 previously documented species were not re-located. Of the 208 species, 66 were graminoids (36 grasses and 30 sedges/rushes). Ninety of these had previously been reported from prairie habitats. Obligate or facultative wetland species comprised 32% of the list. Thirteen species were rare, watch-listed, or uncommon for North Carolina. Big Bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and Eastern Gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides var. dactyloides) had the highest frequency of occurrence during the 2006-07 sampling. Species richness was 6.8 species per m2. Levels of Ca and Mg were much higher than normal for Piedmont soils, and there was significant variation in soil C, N, P and Zn levels among the sampled depths.									3	0	0	4	0	4			0008-7475			WOS:000280655800007

A comparison of techniques for assessing central tendency in left-censored data using PCB and p,p ' DDE contaminant concentrations from Michigan's Bald Eagle Biosentinel Program								CHEMOSPHERE				80	1			7	12		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.03.056			JUN 2010	2010	Monitoring of contaminants in the environment is an important part of understanding the fate of ecosystems after a chemical insult. Frequently, such monitoring efforts result in datasets with observations below the detection limit (DL) that are reported as 'non-detect' or '<DL' and no value is provided. This study explored the effects of non-detect data and their treatment on summary statistics. The data analyzed in this paper are real-world data. They consist of both large (N = 234) and moderate (n = 12-64) sample sizes with both good and marginal fit to an assumed distribution with a log-transformation. Summary statistics were calculated using (1) the '0.0001' near-zero method of substitution, (2) substitution with '1/2 * DL', (3) multiple imputation, and (4) Kaplan-Meier estimation. Median was used for comparison. Several analytical options for datasets with non-detect observations are available. The general consensus is that substitution methods ((1) and (2)) can produce biased summary statistics, especially as levels of substitution increase. Substitution methods continue to be used in research, likely because they are easy to implement. The objectives were to (1) assess the fit of lognormal distribution to the data, (2) compare and contrast the performance of four analytical treatments of left-censored data in terms of estimated geometric mean and standard error, and (3) make recommendations based on those results.

J	Brown, Bryan L.; Lawson, Raven L.				Brown, Bryan/D-9726-2014				Habitat heterogeneity and activity of an omnivorous ecosystem engineer control stream community dynamics								ECOLOGY				91	6			1799	1810		10.1890/09-0350.1			JUN 2010	2010	All communities vary through time. This variability originates from both intrinsic and extrinsic sources. Intrinsic sources are due to actions of organisms in a community, i.e., population dynamics and species interactions, while extrinsic variability is variability created by elements of habitat or environmental change. There is a growing appreciation that these two sources may interact, producing patterns of community variability that cannot be predicted or explained by focusing on a single source. We performed a field experiment that simultaneously manipulated trophic structure (intrinsic) and habitat heterogeneity (extrinsic) in order to examine the interaction between sources of variability in a South Carolina (USA) stream macroinvertebrate community. To manipulate trophic structure, we experimentally altered local abundances of crayfish which are keystone species and ecosystem engineers, while our manipulation of habitat was to alter stream substrate heterogeneity. We focused on two types of community variability as responses to our manipulations: aggregate variability (i.e., variability of summed species) and compositional variability (i.e., variability in relative abundances of species) by monitoring community composition through a 10-week experiment. We found that community dynamics shifted from patterns in variability indicative of synchrony (high aggregate variability + low compositional) to variability indicative of compensation (low aggregate variability + high compositional) along a gradient of increasing habitat heterogeneity. However, the shift in community dynamics only occurred when crayfish were present in the community. Supporting evidence from the experiment suggested that sediment engineering effects of crayfish acted as a community-wide perturbation in low-heterogeneity habitat creating synchronous dynamics. However, in high-heterogeneity enclosures, crayfish effects were moderated by refugia provided by a more complex substratum. The switch from synchronous to compensatory dynamics is significant since compensation stabilizes aggregate community properties and ecosystem functions while synchrony frequently exacerbates aggregate variability. Results from this experiment demonstrate that an interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic sources of variability can alter community dynamics and that such an alteration does not occur in the absence of an interaction.									13	0	0	12	0	13			0012-9658			WOS:000278859700024	20583720	
J	Otim, Samuel; Grover, Varun								E-commerce: a brand name's curse								ELECTRONIC MARKETS				20	2			147	160		10.1007/s12525-010-0039-6			JUN 2010	2010	The reach of the Internet and the low cost of selling products online have made it possible for anybody to participate in the online market. In this paper, we argue that e-commerce can be a brand name's curse due to information asymmetries and the existence of indifferent consumers, which perpetuate counterfeiting of branded products and the infringement of brand names in e-markets. Counterfeiting and infringement devalue the information capital embodied in a brand name, and ultimately reduce sales and profits of the brand name holders. While legal measures have been enacted to deal with intellectual property problems, we argue that market mechanisms are more efficient and more effective in dealing with brand name problems in e-markets. This is because rules in themselves often provide neither the slightest hint of where to look for violations, nor the incentive to convict violators. Market mechanisms such as information syndication, pricing of e-markets services, and vendor malpractice could be effective in deterring counterfeiting and brand name infringement. We hope our positional contribution will stir interest to look into this serious problem and extend our suggestions by developing concrete innovative mechanisms to safeguard online transactions.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1019-6781			WOS:000282926400008		
J	Smart, Julie B.; Igo, L. Brent								A Grounded Theory of Behavior Management Strategy Selection, Implementation, and Perceived Effectiveness Reported by First-Year Elementary Teachers								ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL				110	4			567	584					JUN 2010	2010	In this grounded theory study, 19 teachers were interviewed and then, in constant comparative fashion, the interview data were analyzed. The theoretical model that emerged from the data describes novice teachers' tendencies to select and implement differing strategies related to the severity of student behavior. When confronting mild student misbehaviors, teachers perceived their behavior management strategies to be more effective and reported implementing such strategies with greater consistency. When facing more severe misbehaviors, novice teachers perceived their management strategies to be largely ineffective and reported implementing them inconsistently. Ultimately, this grounded theory postulates that when novice teachers lack relevant college coursework their default behavior management strategies may be effective for addressing mildly disruptive student behaviors. Furthermore, the theory supports the prediction that preservice teachers might benefit most from specific training in dealing with more severe misbehaviors. Implications for teacher education and professional development are discussed.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0013-5984			WOS:000277345200007

Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Stink Bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in Wheat								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				39	3			944	955		10.1603/EN09274			JUN 2010	2010	A 2-yr study was conducted in South Carolina wheat fields to describe spatial and temporal dynamics of stink bugs sampled with sweep nets. In 2008, the main phytophagous species were Euschistus servus (Say) (35.8, 36.7%), Oebalus pugnax (F.) (35.0, 6.0%), Nezara viridula L., (15.2, 46.3%), and Thyanta custator (F.) (14.0,10.5%) for adults and nymphs, respectively. In 2009, the main phytophagous species were O. pugnax (39.8, 37.8%), E. servus (38.4, 30.0%), N. viridula (14.6, 29.5%), and T. custator (6.8, 2.8%). chi(2) goodness-of-fit tests indicated that all species (both adults and nymphs) had observed distributions that did not match the Poisson distribution. Indices of dispersion (I(D)) across sampling dates were significantly >1 for all species and life stages, also suggesting a nonrandom distribution. Slopes of Taylor's power law were significantly greater (P < 0.05) than a value of 1 for only adult O. pugnax and nymph T. custator. Coefficients beta of patchiness regressions were significantly >1 in all cases except for E. serum adults and T. custator nymphs. The inverted distance weighted interpolation method showed considerable levels of spatial variability in densities within fields. Sampling along the edge of fields showed a significant distance from field border effect (P < 0.05) on all adults in both years except for N. viridula. High densities in wheat adjacent to a susceptible crop such as corn suggests that localized control methods in wheat may be effective in mitigation of stink bugs and damage in corn.									28	0	0	28	0	29			0046-225X			WOS:000278319100025	20550810

Spatial Dynamics of Stink Bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) and Associated Boll Injury in Southeastern Cotton Fields								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				39	3			956	969		10.1603/EN09237			JUN 2010	2010	Grid sampling (one sample per 0.40 ha) in 12 cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fields for stink bugs and boll injury caused by stink bug feeding was conducted in 2007 and 2008 in South Carolina and Georgia. The main species collected using the beat cloth method were the green stink bug, Acrosternum hilare (Say) (69%); brown stink bug, Euschistus serous (Say) (18%); and the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.) (14%), respectively. The inverted distance weighted interpolation method and Spatial Analysis by Distance IndicEs analyses showed spatial variability in both boll injury and stink bug densities. Four of five fields with field-average boll injury exceeding 15% had a combination of either soybean or peanut adjacent to the cotton field of interest. The Spatial Analysis by Distance IndicEs index of dispersion for stink bug densities and boll injury averaged over the season indicated significant aggregation at the 5% error rate in only one and four analyses (combinations of fields, species, and life stages) of a total of 54 in 2007 and 2008, respectively. By sampling date, overall indices of dispersion for boll injury data indicated significant aggregation in four of the 63 date-field combinations at the 5% error rate. Across years, overall indices of spatial association between boll injury anti stink bug densities were significant in 17 of 69 analyses, with positive associations detected in seven of 12 fields; these data suggest that spatial distribution of stink bugs in cotton fields does not always coincide with boll injury.									20	0	0	20	0	20			0046-225X			WOS:000278319100026	20550811

It is also widely used for the removal of organics in water treatment and as a catalyst or catalyst support in some industrial applications. In this study, it was discovered that AC materials can catalyze transformation of secondary amines to yield trace levels of N-nitrosamines under ambient aerobic conditions. All 11 commercial ACs tested in the study formed nitrosamines from secondary amines. Among the different ACs, the N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) yield at pH 7.5 ranged from 0.001% to 0.01% of initial amount of aqueous dimethylamine (DMA) concentration, but at 0.05-0.29% of the amount of adsorbed DMA by AC. Nitrosamine yield increased with higher pH and for higher molecular weight secondary amines, probably because of increased adsorption of amines. Presence of oxygen was a critical factor in the transformation of secondary amines, since ACs with adsorbed secondary amines dried under air for longer period of time exhibited significantly higher nitrosamine yields. The AC-catalyzed nitrosamine formation was also observed in surface water and wastewater effluent samples. Properties of AC play an important role in the nitrosamine yields. Preliminary evaluation indicated that nitrosamine formation was higher on reduced than oxidized AC surfaces. Overall, the study results show that selecting ACs and reaction conditions are important to minimize analytical errors and undesirable formation associated with nitrosamines in water samples.									27	1	0	21	0	28			0013-936X			WOS:000278003500023	20446739

Three-Dimensional Landscape Visualizations: New Technique towards Wildfire and Forest Bark Beetle Management								FORESTS				1	2			82	97		10.3390/f1020082			JUN 2010	2010	After a century of fire exclusion, western US forests are vulnerable to wildfire and bark beetles. Although integrated fire and pest management programs (e. g., prescribed burning and thinning) are being implemented efficiently, damage to forests continues. Management challenges come in the forms of diverse land ownership, dynamic forest landscapes, the uncertainty effect of management strategies, and social interaction of the increasing wildland-urban interface. Three-dimensional (3-D) landscape visualization is comprised of multi-spatial, multi-temporal, and multi-expression elements. Supplemented with GIS database, remote sensing images, and simulation models, this technique can provide a comprehensive communication medium for decision makers, scientists, stakeholders, and the public with diverse backgrounds on the wildfire and forest bark beetle management. The technique we describe here can be used to organize complicated temporal and spatial information, evaluate alternative management operations, and improve decision-making processes. The application and limitations of our technique are also discussed.									2	1	0	1	0	3			1999-4907			WOS:000208656700001

Two sharp dispersionless modes are found at 0.85 and 1.16 meV in CeFeAsO below the Ce antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering temperature of T-N(Ce) similar to 4 K. On warming to above T-N(Ce) similar to 4 K, these two modes become one broad dispersionless mode that disappears just above the Fe ordering temperature T-N(Fe) similar to 140 K. For superconducting CeFeAsO0.84F0.16, where Fe static AF order is suppressed, we find a weakly dispersive mode center at 0.4 meV that may arise from short-range Ce-Ce exchange interactions. Using a Heisenberg model, we simulate powder-averaged Ce spin wave excitations. Our results show that we need both Ce spin wave and crystal electric field excitations to account for the whole spectra of low-energy spin excitations.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1673-3487	1673-3606		WOS:000280414400005

Interactions of the crustacean nuclear receptors HR3 and E75 in the regulation of gene transcription								GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY				167	2			268	278		10.1016/j.ygcen.2010.03.025			JUN 1 2010	2010	Endocrine signal transduction occurs through cascades that involve the action of both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent nuclear receptors. In insects, two such nuclear receptors are HR3 and E75 that interact to transduce signals initiated by ecdysteroids. We have cloned these nuclear receptors from the crustacean Daphnia pulex to assess their function as regulators of gene transcription in this ecologically and economically important group of organisms. Both nuclear receptors from D. pulex (DappuHR3 (group NR1F) and DappuE75 (group NR1D)) exhibit a high degree of sequence similarity to other NR1F and NR1D group members that is indicative of monomeric binding to the RORE (retinoid orphan receptor element). DappuE75 possesses key amino acid residues required for heme binding to the ligand-binding domain. Next, we developed a gene transcription reporter assay containing a luciferase reporter gene driven by the RORE. DappuHR3, but not DappuE75, activated transcription of the luciferase gene in this system. Co-transfection experiments revealed that DappuE75 suppressed DappuHR3-dependent luciferase transcription in a dose-dependent manner. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that DappuHR3 bound to the RORE. However, we found no evidence that DappuE75 similarly bound to the response element. These experiments further demonstrated that DappuE75 prevented DappuHR3 from binding to the response element. In conclusion, DappuHR3 functions as a transcriptional activator of genes regulated by the RORE and DappuE75 is a negative regulator of this activity. DappuE75 does not suppress the action of DappuHR3 by occupying the response element but presumably interacts directly with the DappuHR3 protein. Taken together with the previous demonstration that daphnid HR3 is highly induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone, these results support the premise that HR3 is a major component of ecdysteroid signaling in some crustaceans and is under the negative regulatory control of E75.

J	McLay, Laura A.; Mayorga, Maria E.								Evaluating emergency medical service performance measures								HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT SCIENCE				13	2			124	136		10.1007/s10729-009-9115-x			JUN 2010	2010	The ultimate goal of emergency medical service systems is to save lives. However, most emergency medical service systems have performance measures for responding to 911 calls within a fixed timeframe (i.e., a response time threshold), rather than measures related to patient outcomes. These response time thresholds are used because they are easy to obtain and to understand. This paper proposes a methodology for evaluating the performance of response time thresholds in terms of resulting patient survival rates. A model that locates ambulances to optimize patient survival rates is used for base comparison. Results are illustrated using real-world data collected from Hanover County, Virginia. The results indicate that locating ambulances to maximize seven and eight min response time thresholds simultaneously maximize patient survival. Nine and 10 min response time thresholds result in more equitable patient outcomes, with improved patient survival rates in rural regions.									33	0	0	0	1	34			1386-9620			WOS:000281585300003	20629415

The two degrees of freedom provided by the use of two dc/dc converters enable the independent low-level control of dc bus voltage and the current split between the FC and UC. The supervisory-level control objectives are to respond to rapid variations in load while minimizing damaging fluctuations in FC current and maintaining the UC charge (or voltage) within allowable bounds. The use of a model predictive control approach which optimally balances the distribution of power between the FC and UC while satisfying the constraints is shown to be an effective method for meeting the supervisory-level objectives. The results are confirmed in experiments.									33	1	0	0	0	34			0278-0046			WOS:000277664000012

A Taxonomy and Analysis of Camera Calibration Methods for Traffic Monitoring Applications								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS				11	2			441	452		10.1109/TITS.2010.2045500			JUN 2010	2010	Many vision-based automatic traffic-monitoring systems require a calibrated camera to compute the speeds and length-based classifications of tracked vehicles. A number of techniques, both manual and automatic, have been proposed for performing such calibration, but no study has yet focused on evaluating the relative strengths of these different alternatives. We present a taxonomy for roadside camera calibration that not only encompasses the existing methods (VVW, VWH, and VWL) but also includes several novel methods (VVH, VVL, VLH, VVD, VWD, and VHD). We also introduce an overconstrained (OC) approach that takes into account all the available measurements, resulting in reduced error and overcoming the inherent ambiguity in single-vanishing-point solutions. This important but oft-neglected ambiguity has not received the attention that it deserves; we analyze it and propose several ways of overcoming it. Our analysis includes the relative tradeoffs between two-vanishing-point solutions, single-vanishing-point solutions, and solutions that require the distance to the road to be known. The various methods are compared using simulations and experiments with real images, showing that methods that use a known length generally outperform the others in terms of error and that the OC method reduces errors even further.									34	2	0	0	0	36			1524-9050			WOS:000278538600020

The noise voltage density is obtained. The proposed lumped element transmission line model describes noise properties of the patterned Py array well. Measurement data show that rapid ferromagnetic resonance frequencies (FMR) shift induced by dc bias current is related to the excess magnetization fluctuation thermally created by the combined dc current Joule heating effects and orthogonal Oersted fields.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0018-9464			WOS:000278037800303

Sequential Probability Ratio Test Using Scaled Time-Intervals for Environmental Radiation Monitoring								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE				57	3			1556	1562		10.1109/TNS.2010.2045900			JUN 2010	2010	Sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) of scaled time-interval data (time to record N radiation pulses), SPRT_scaled, was evaluated against commonly used single-interval test (SIT) and SPRT with a fixed counting interval, SPRT_fixed, on experimental and simulated data. Experimental data were acquired with a DGF-4C (XIA, Inc) system in list mode. Simulated time-interval data were obtained using Monte Carlo techniques to perform a random radiation sampling of the Poisson distribution. The three methods (SIT, SPRT_fixed and SPRT_scaled) were compared in terms of detection probability and average time to make a decision regarding the source of radiation. For both experimental and simulated data, SPRT_scaled provided similar detection probabilities as other tests, but was able to make a quicker decision with fewer pulses at relatively higher radiation levels. SPRT_scaled has a provision for varying the sampling time depending on the radiation level, which may further shorten the time needed for radiation monitoring. Parameter adjustments to the SPRT_scaled method for increased detection probability are discussed.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0018-9499			WOS:000278812300006		
J	Shen, Haiying								An Efficient and Adaptive Decentralized File Replication Algorithm in P2P File Sharing Systems								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				21	6			827	840		10.1109/TPDS.2009.127			JUN 2010	2010	In peer-to-peer file sharing systems, file replication technology is widely used to reduce hot spots and improve file query efficiency. Most current file replication methods replicate files in all nodes or two end points on a client-server query path. However, these methods either have low effectiveness or come at a cost of high overhead. File replication in server side enhances replica hit rate, hence, lookup efficiency but produces overloaded nodes and cannot significantly reduce query path length. File replication in client side could greatly reduce query path length, but cannot guarantee high replica hit rate to fully utilize replicas. Though replication along query path solves these problems, it comes at a high cost of overhead due to more replicas and produces underutilized replicas. This paper presents an Efficient and Adaptive Decentralized (EAD) file replication algorithm that achieves high query efficiency and high replica utilization at a significantly low cost. EAD enhances the utilization of file replicas by selecting query traffic hubs and frequent requesters as replica nodes, and dynamically adapting to nonuniform and time-varying file popularity and node interest. Unlike current methods, EAD creates and deletes replicas in a decentralized self-adaptive manner while guarantees high replica utilization. Theoretical analysis shows the high performance of EAD. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of EAD in comparison with other approaches in both static and dynamic environments. It dramatically reduces the overhead of file replication, and yields significant improvements on the efficiency and effectiveness of file replication in terms of query efficiency, replica hit rate, and overloaded nodes reduction.									19	2	0	0	0	21			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000276899800008

A closed form mechanistic cutting force model for helical peripheral milling of ductile metallic alloys								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE				50	6			538	551		10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2010.03.003			JUN 2010	2010	A closed form mechanistic model is developed for cutting forces in helical peripheral milling (endmilling) of ductile metallic alloys. This paper presents an alternative derivation, using the frontal chip area, to describe two series of cutting force expressions-one using a Heaviside unit step function and the other using a Fourier series expansion. A specific advantage of the present work is highlighted by deriving analytical expressions for sensitivity coefficients required to analytically propagate the uncertainty in the cutting-force model parameters. Another advantage is that even very small radial immersions can be used to derive cutting coefficients reliably, along with their variances. The aforementioned analytical investigations are applied to a series of experimental cutting tests to estimate the force-model cutting coefficients. Experimental investigations include the study of a tool having radial runout. Finally, confidence intervals are placed on predicted forces which experimentally verify the validity of the proposed force model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We have also performed simulations with electron-ion jets. The simulations were performed using a much longer simulation system than our previous simulations in order to investigate the full nonlinear stage of the Weibel instability for electron-positron jets and its particle acceleration mechanism. Cold jet electrons are thermalized and ambient electrons are accelerated in the resulting shocks for pair plasma case. Acceleration of ambient electrons leads to a maximum ambient electron density three times larger than the original value for pair plasmas. Behind the bow shock in the jet shock strong electromagnetic fields are generated. These fields may lead to time-dependent afterglow emission. We calculated radiation from electrons propagating in a uniform parallel magnetic field to verify the technique. We also used the new technique to calculate emission from electrons based on simulations with a small system with two different cases for Lorentz factors (15 and 100). We obtained spectra which are consistent with those generated from electrons propagating in turbulent magnetic fields with red noise. This turbulent magnetic field is similar to the magnetic field generated at an early nonlinear stage of the Weibel instability.

By computing exact solutions of the Riemann problem describing this scenario, we find that with the same initial Lorentz factor, the reverse shock becomes progressively weaker with increasing magnetization parameter sigma (the Poynting-to-kinetic flux ratio). The reverse shock becomes a rarefaction wave when s exceeds a critical value defined by the balance between magnetic pressure in the ejecta and thermal pressure in the forward shock. In the rarefaction wave regime, the rarefied region is accelerated to a Lorentz factor that is significantly larger than the initial value due to the strong magnetic pressure in the ejecta. We discuss the implications for models of GRBs.

In fact, we note that there are only two articles specifically related to gender differences in work sample exams. Based on theory and literature from social psychology, neuropsychology, and applied psychology, we propose that the three constructs of self-concept, social skills, and writing skills are likely to influence work sample gender differences. We tested our hypotheses on two samples of managers. We found in one instance that males scored higher on a technical exercise, but there was stronger support for females, on average, scoring higher on exercises that involved social skills and on exercises that involved writing skills. Work samples that targeted a broad array of knowledge, skills, and abilities were associated with higher overall scores for females (ds of -.37 and -.34) and, thus, were unlikely to be associated with gender-based adverse impact against females.									4	0	0	0	1	5			0965-075X			WOS:000277920700001

Compost samples were analysed for coliforms and enriched for Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes. The waste materials and composting practices differed among the surveyed farms. On two farms, new materials were added to heaps that had previously completed the active composting phase. Five compost heaps did not reach an internal temperature of 55 degrees C, and c. 62% of all internal samples in the first composting phase contained moisture contents < 40%. Escherichia coli was detected in 63% of the surface samples (n = 38) and 9 center dot 8% of the internal samples (n = 82) from the first composting phase, as compared with 16 center dot 7% of the surface samples (n = 12) and 0% internal samples (n = 24) from the second composting phase. Salmonella was detected in 26 and 6 center dot 1% of all surface and internal samples collected from heaps in the first composting phase, respectively, but was absent in all compost samples undergoing a second composting phase. The predominant Salmonella serotypes were Thompson, Montevideo and Anatum. Neither E. coli O157:H7 nor L. monocytogenes was detected in any of the samples.Conclusions:Our results indicate that the conditions at the compost surface are suitable for pathogen survival, and the complete composting process can result in the elimination of pathogens in poultry wastes.Significance and Impact of the Study:This research provides information regarding the effectiveness of the composting practices and microbiological quality of poultry compost produced by small- and medium-sized farms. Ensuring the safety of compost that may be applied to soils should be an integral part of preharvest food safety programme.									13	0	0	6	1	13			1364-5072	1365-2672		WOS:000277412600022	19922596

Through the use of Palm measures, we show that previous laws (see Bertsimas and Mourtzinou (1997)) can be generalized. Furthermore, within this framework, a new law can be derived as well, which gives higher-moment expressions for very general types of queueing system; in particular, the laws hold for systems that allow customers to overtake one another. What is especially novel about our approach is the use of Palm measures that are induced by nonstationary point processes, as these measures are not commonly found in the queueing literature. This new higher-moment law is then used to provide expressions for all moments of the number of customers in the system in an M/G/1 preemptive last-come first-served queue at a time t > 0, for any initial condition and any of the more famous preemptive disciplines (i.e. preemptive-resume, and preemptive-repeat with and without resampling) that are analogous to the special cases found in Abate and Whitt (1987c), (1988). These expressions are then used to derive a nice structural form for all of the time-dependent moments of a regulated Brownian motion (see Abate and Whitt (1987a), (1987b)).									7	0	0	0	0	7			0021-9002			WOS:000279511900011		
J	Perpich, Diane								Vulnerability and the Ethics of Facial Tissue Transplantation								JOURNAL OF BIOETHICAL INQUIRY				7	2	SI		173	185		10.1007/s11673-010-9236-4			JUN 2010	2010	Two competing intuitions have dominated the debate over facial tissue transplantation. On one side are those who argue that relieving the suffering of those with severe facial disfigurement justifies the medical risks and possible loss of life associated with this experimental procedure. On the other are those who say that there is little evidence to show that such transplants would have longterm psychological benefits that couldn't be achieved by other means and that without clear benefits, the risk is simply too great. Ethicists on both sides have called for more analysis of the link between the face and personal identity in order to get a better grasp on potential gains and losses. This paper responds to that call by looking at contemporary philosophical analyses of the relation between organ transplants and personal identity and between the human face, human dignity, and human vulnerability. It is argued that the face matters not because it is the unique marker of our identity, but because of its role in the intersubjective constitution of moral identity and human dignity.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1176-7529			WOS:000277788600005

Absorption spectra, especially (13)C NMR, provided good indication of its structure, which was conclusively established with X-ray crystal structure analysis. In comparison to the few benzothiopyran X-ray reports documented, the benzothiopyranone ring of the molecule was found to be essentially planar, with the 3-phenyl ring nearly perpendicular to the benzothiopyranone fused-ring system.

Paola Vera; McGee, John; Laubenbacher, Reinhard								Discretization of Time Series Data								JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY				17	6			853	868		10.1089/cmb.2008.0023			JUN 2010	2010	An increasing number of algorithms for biochemical network inference from experimental data require discrete data as input. For example, dynamic Bayesian network methods and methods that use the framework of finite dynamical systems, such as Boolean networks, all take discrete input. Experimental data, however, are typically continuous and represented by computer floating point numbers. The translation from continuous to discrete data is crucial in preserving the variable dependencies and thus has a significant impact on the performance of the network inference algorithms. We compare the performance of two such algorithms that use discrete data using several different discretization algorithms. One of the inference methods uses a dynamic Bayesian network framework, the other-a time- and state-discrete dynamical system framework. The discretization algorithms are quantile, interval discretization, and a new algorithm introduced in this article, SSD. SSD is especially designed for short time series data and is capable of determining the optimal number of discretization states. The experiments show that both inference methods perform better with SSD than with the other methods. In addition, SSD is demonstrated to preserve the dynamic features of the time series, as well as to be robust to noise in the experimental data. A C++ implementation of SSD is available from the authors at http://polymath.vbi.vt.edu/discretization.									15	2	0	10	0	17			1066-5277			WOS:000279272800007	20583929

Velocity-vorticity-helicity formulation and a solver for the Navier-Stokes equations								JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS				229	11			4291	4303		10.1016/j.jcp.2010.02.012			JUN 1 2010	2010	For the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, we present a formulation featuring velocity, vorticity and helical density as independent variables. We find the helical density can be observed as a Lagrange multiplier corresponding to the divergence-free constraint on the vorticity variable, similar to the pressure in the case of the incompressibility condition for velocity. As one possible practical application of this new formulation, we consider a time-splitting numerical scheme based on an alternating procedure between vorticity-helical density and velocity-Bernoulli pressure systems of equations. Results of numerical experiments include a comparison with some well-known schemes based on pressure-velocity formulation and illustrate the competitiveness on the new scheme as well as the soundness of the new formulation.

The proposed packing algorithm is designed to pack three-dimensional free-form objects inside an arbitrary enclosure such that the packing efficiency is maximized. The proposed packing algorithm can handle objects with holes or cavities, and its performance does not degrade significantly with the increase in complexity of the enclosure or the objects. The packing algorithm takes as input the tessellated geometry of the container and all the objects to be packed and outputs the list of objects that can be placed inside the enclosure. The packing algorithm also outputs the location and orientation of all the objects, the packing sequence, and the packed configuration. An improved layout algorithm that works with arbitrary container geometry is also proposed. Separate layout algorithms for the SAE and ISO luggage are developed. Several heuristics to improve the performance of the packing algorithm are also incorporated. Certain aspects that facilitate fast and efficient handling of the computer aided design (CAD) data are also discussed. A comprehensive benchmarking of the proposed packing algorithm on synthetic and hypothetical problems reflects its superior performance as compared with other similar approaches.

The objectives of this study were to characterize feed protein fractions and evaluate differences in rumen-undegradable protein (RUP) and its digestible fraction (dRUP), amino acid concentration, and in vitro gas production of 7 corn milling co-products. The crude protein (CP; % of dry matter) of co-products was 12.7 for germ, 26.9 for dried distillers grains plus solubles that had no heat exposure before fermentation (DDGS1), 45.4 for highprotein dried distillers grains (HPDDG), 12.7 for bran, 30.2 for wet distillers grains plus solubles (WDGS), 23.1 for wet corn gluten feed (WCGF), and 26.0 for dried distillers grains plus solubles that had heat exposure before fermentation (DDGS2). Two ruminally and duodenally fistulated Holstein steers weighing 663 +/- 24 kg were used to determine RUP and dRUP with the in situ and mobile bag techniques. Samples of each feed were ruminally incubated for 16 h, and mobile bags were exposed to simulated abomasal digestion before insertion into the duodenum and subsequent collection in the feces. Protein fractions A, B1, B2, B3, and C were characterized as follows (% CP): germ = 30.0, 15.0, 38.1, 13.5, 3.4; DDGS1 = 17.0, 7.0, 67.0, 4.8, 4.2; HPDDG = 7.4, 0.6, 82.4, 8.8, 0.8; bran = 33.5, 4.0, 54.3, 6.0, 2.2; WDGS = 18.6, 2.4, 53.1, 11.0, 14.9; WCGF = 36.6, 15.9, 33.2, 10.1, 4.1; and DDGS2 = 17.9, 2.1, 41.1, 11.1, 27.9. The proportions of RUP and dRUP were different and are reported as follows (% CP): DDGS2 = 56.3, 91.9; HPDDG = 55.2, 97.7; WDGS = 44.7, 93.1; DDGS1 = 33.2, 92.1; bran = 20.7, 65.8; germ = 16.5, 66.8; and WCGF = 11.5, 51.1. The concentrations of Lys and Met in the RUP were different and are listed as follows (% CP): germ = 2.9, 2.0; DDGS1 = 1.9, 2.0; HPDDG = 2.0, 3.2; bran = 3.2, 1.5; WDGS = 1.9, 2.3; WCGF = 3.5, 1.6; and DDGS2 = 1.9, 2.4. In vitro gas production (mL/48 h) was highest for germ (52.1) followed by bran (50.1), WDGS (40.7), DDGS2 (40.1), WCGF (39.0), DDGS1 (38.6), and HPDDG (37.5). Comparison of co-products defined differences in chemical composition, protein fractionation, ruminal availability, and microbial fermentation.									19	2	0	18	0	22			0022-0302			WOS:000277929100057	20494190

From this systematic monitoring it can be shown that diffusion and stress relaxation processes over time lead to the host atoms migrating to their proper equilibrium positions, and a more uniform redistribution of impurities or structural defects is formed. We demonstrate that the highly ordered nature that develops over time, 40 years in this case, facilitates enhanced stimulated emission and increases the radiative recombination efficiency and spectral range of luminescence. This suggests new ways to realize semiconductor devices with greater temporal stability.					13th International Conference on Defects - Recognition, Imaging and Physics in Semiconductors (DRIP XIII)13th International Conference on Defects - Recognition, Imaging and Physics in Semiconductors (DRIP XIII)	SEP 13-17, 2009SEP 13-17, 2009	Minerals, Met & Mat Soc; FEI; Semilab; Quantum Focus; Off Naval Res; Air Force Off Sci Res; Army Res OffMinerals, Met & Mat Soc; FEI; Semilab; Quantum Focus; Off Naval Res; Air Force Off Sci Res; Army Res Off	Oglebay, WVOglebay, WV	3	0	0	0	0	3			0361-5235			WOS:000277712000005

Based in part on a System of Systems (SoS) analysis of provider coordination and resource flows, this paper expands the concepts of resource foraging theory and event dynamics to develop systematic methods for studying healthcare provider coordination. Process flow and human factors emphases from industrial engineering are used to address critical concerns of single-scale and multi-scale performance in healthcare delivery settings. Provider strategies for acquiring the information and resources needed for successful healthcare delivery are dependent on interactions between task requirements, time constraints, and provider coordination processes, as well as limitations of information and resource flow capabilities. These improved definitions and measures will enhance engineers' ability to contribute to improved patient care timeliness, effectiveness, quality, and safety.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2040-2295			WOS:000208547500007

In this respect, clinical trials with various ErbB receptor blocking antibodies and specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors have proven to be partially efficacious in the treatment of this heterogeneous disease. Induction of an embryonic program of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer, whereupon epithelial tumor cells convert to a more mesenchymal-like phenotype, facilitates the migration, intravasation, and extravasation of tumor cells during metastasis. Breast cancers which exhibit properties of EMT are highly aggressive and resistant to therapy. Activation of ErbB signaling can regulate EMT-associated invasion and migration in normal and malignant mammary epithelial cells, as well as modulating discrete stages of mammary gland development. The purpose of this review is to summarize current information regarding the role of ErbB signaling in aspects of EMT that influence epithelial cell plasticity during mammary gland development and tumorigenesis. How this information may contribute to the improvement of therapeutic approaches in breast cancer will also be addressed.									70	4	0	59	0	73			1083-3021			WOS:000278835900006	20369376

Suitability of these material models for the use in structural-mechanics and ballistic-resistance computational analyses of the composite laminates is investigated by carrying out a series of computational studies in which a composite laminate is either subjected to in-plane tension/compression or bending or used as a target plate and impacted by a solid right circular cylindrical projectile. The results obtained suggest that the fracture-mechanics enriched meso-scale composite-laminate material model, in which the fracture-mechanics character of micro-cracking is included within a damage-mechanics formulation, is currently the best compromise between computational efficiency and physical-reality/fidelity.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0022-2461			WOS:000276609000002

This work first demonstrates negative and positive dielectrophoretic focusing of particles in a serpentine microchannel by changing only the electric conductivity of the suspending fluid. Due to the channel turn-induced dielectrophoretic force, particles are focused to either the centerline or the sidewalls of the channel when their electric conductivity is lower (i.e. negative DEP) or higher (i.e. positive DEP) than that of the fluid. These distinctive dielectrophoretic focusing phenomena in a serpentine microchannel are then combined to implement a continuous separation between particles of different sizes and electric conductivities. Such separation eliminates the fabrication of in-channel microelectrodes or micro-insulators that are typically required in DEP-based separation techniques. A numerical model is also developed to predict the particle motion, and the simulation results agree reasonably with the observed particle focusing and separation behaviors.									24	1	0	15	0	25			0960-1317			WOS:000278268200032

The method is based on minimizing a functional (of the initial condition and the period) that is positive unless the solution is periodic, in which case it is zero. We solve an adjoint PDE to compute the gradient of this functional with respect to the initial condition. We include additional terms in the functional to specify the free parameters, which in the case of the Benjamin-Ono equation, are the mean, a spatial phase, a temporal phase, and the real part of one of the Fourier modes at t=0.We use our method to study global paths of nontrivial time-periodic solutions connecting stationary and traveling waves of the Benjamin-Ono equation. As a starting guess for each path, we compute periodic solutions of the linearized problem by solving an infinite dimensional eigenvalue problem in closed form. We then use our numerical method to continue these solutions beyond the realm of linear theory until another traveling wave is reached. By experimentation with data fitting, we identify the analytical form of the solutions on the path connecting the one-hump stationary solution to the two-hump traveling wave. We then derive exact formulas for these solutions by explicitly solving the system of ODEs governing the evolution of solitons using the ansatz suggested by the numerical simulations.									18	0	0	0	0	18			0938-8974			WOS:000277298300001

The chemical structure at the hydrogen-saturated interface (the distribution of terminal hydrocarbon moieties, in particular) shows a weak dependence on the mass of the impinging atoms. However, the sputtering yields increase considerably with increasing projectile mass. We analyze the threshold energies of chemical sputtering reaction channels and show that they are nearly mass independent, as expected from elementary bond-breaking chemical reactions involving hydrocarbons. Chemical sputtering yields for D impact are compared with new experimental data. Good agreement is found for small hydrocarbons but the simulations overestimate the production of large hydrocarbons for energies larger than 15 eV. We present a thorough analysis of the dependence of our simulations on the parameters of the bombardment schemes and discuss open questions and possible avenues for development.

Esterification as a diagnostic tool to predict proton conductivity affected by impurities on Nafion components for proton exchange membrane fuel cells								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				195	11	SI		3416	3424		10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.12.023			JUN 1 2010	2010	Quantitative data of the effect of contaminants on individual components of a PEMFC is limited and difficult to acquire, especially for the ionomer in the catalyst layer. In this paper, we propose the use of an acid-catalysed reaction (esterification) as a method to quantitatively investigate the effect of contaminants on proton availability and conductivity of Nafion components, since proton sites in Nafion are also active as Bronsted acid sites for catalysis. It was found that at typical fuel cell conditions, ammonia adsorption decreased both conductivity and esterification activity of Nafion in a uniform manner. Because of the linear relationship between the number of proton/acid sites and both the conductivity and the esterification activity, a correlation between the two could be developed taking into account differences in the effect of humidity on the conductivity/activity of the poisoned Nafion. The methodology and correlation developed were also shown to predict accurately the effect of another impurity species (Na+) on Nafion conductivity. The results demonstrate the application of esterification as a means to quantify the number of proton sites poisoned by adsorbing impurities, permitting the prediction of Nafion conductivity. This method would be applicable to both the membrane and ionomer in the catalyst layer. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000275386100010

Solubility and sorption properties of some phosphate fertilizer components on soils								JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY				284	3			653	658		10.1007/s10967-010-0535-3			JUN 2010	2010	Phosphate rock (Pho-ore) is the starting raw material used in manufacturing of most phosphate products. This material contains phosphorous, natural uranium, thorium potassium radionuclide and other trace elements. Single super phosphate powder (SSPho-P), single super phosphate granules (SSPho-G), and triple super phosphate (TSPho) are the common phosphate products produced along with phosphogypsym (CaSO(4)) as a waste product. Since these materials are industrially manufactured by the reaction of the phosphate ore with phosphoric and sulphuric acids, these products and the waste product are extremely acidic. Pho-ore, SSPho-P, SSPho-G, TSPho and CaSO(4) samples were used in our study. Chemical analyses showed that these phosphate samples contain phosphorous, iron, aluminum ions and traces of uranium ions. Accumulation of the fertilizers on soils usually transfers some of these ions from the fertilizer materials to the soil/water interfaces. The migration of uranium U(VI), P, Al and Fe in subsurface soils was found to be strongly influenced by the sorption/desorption reaction at the solid/water interfaces. Thus, dissolution of these ions in soil/water phases is very important. Speciation of U(VI), P, Al and Fe in soil/water phases were calculated using a geochemical code (MINTEQA2). This study was conducted to determine sorption properties and the surface electrical properties of these ions at the soil samples.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0236-5731			WOS:000276910200025

The headspace-matrix partition coefficients (K(HS/matrix)) of each compound in the different matrixes were established using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The particle size of the emulsions was controlled. Fat had the largest impact on the BET and partition coefficients of delta-decalactone followed by diacetyl (P < 0.05). Fat content did not affect the BET value of furaneol (P > 0.05) but some effects on partition coefficients were noted (P < 0.05). BET values of the three compounds were unaffected by pH (P > 0.05), but differences in partition coefficients (P < 0.05) were noted for diacetyl and furaneol.PRACTICAL APPLICATIONSThis manuscript provides a better understanding of sensory detection thresholds as a result of partitioning of three flavor compounds that are different in physico-chemical properties and are prominent in dairy product flavor. The acquired knowledge on these compounds may assist product developers in adjusting levels of flavor compounds in reduced fat products to achieve products similar in flavor properties to full fat products, considering the effect of fat and pH of the products on the compounds.

The Demand for Environmental Quality: An Application of Hedonic Pricing in Golf								JOURNAL OF SPORTS ECONOMICS				11	3			261	286		10.1177/1527002509337801			JUN 2010	2010	The analysis uses an exhaustive golf course database that contains over 100 golf course variables on more than 15,000 golf courses in the United States combined with data from the Audubon International Cooperative Sanctuary Program to examine the market setting of environmental certification on golf courses. Using the Rosen (1974) two-stage estimation technique, quality-adjusted structural demand and supply equations for golf are estimated. A standard hedonic pricing model shows a substantial price premium for environmentally certified Audubon International golf courses. Additional results suggest that the increase in marginal benefits of certification is approximately equal to the increase in marginal costs.									2	0	0	1	0	3			1527-0025			WOS:000277534700002

Refractive indices were measured at six discrete wavelengths from 0.633 to 10.59 mu m using a prism coupler, and data were fitted to the Sellmeier expression. Optical basicity was computed using three models-average electronegativity, ionic-covalent parameter, and energy gap-and the results were used to compute oxygen polarizability and subsequently the refractive index. Single oscillator energy and dispersion energy were calculated from experimental indices and from oxide energy parameters. The predicted glass index dispersion based on oxide oscillator parameters underestimates the measured index by only 3%-4%. The predicted glass index from optical basicity, based on oxide energy gaps, underpredicts the index at 0.633 mu m by only 2%. The calculated glass energy gap based on this optical basicity overpredicts the experimental optical gap by 6%-10%. Thus, we have shown that the density, the refractive index in the visible, and the energy gap can be reasonably predicted using only composition, optical basicity values for the constituent oxides, and partial molar volume coefficients. The relative contributions of the oxides to the total polarizability were assessed, providing an additional insight into controlling the refractivity of high-index glasses.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0002-7820			WOS:000278309100031

A 7(th) species of Manophylax new for science is described and illustrated from Alaska. Habitats of larvae and pupae of the different Manophylax species are either mostly hygropetric or mostly terrestrial. Phylogenetic analysis infers 3 principal species groups occurring in the eastern and western Nearctic and eastern Palearctic Biogeographic Regions. The habitat of the western Nearctic M. annulatus Species Group is mostly hygropetric and that of the eastern Nearctic M. altus and eastern Palearctic M. futabae Species Groups are mostly terrestrial. The phylogeny suggests that the mostly terrestrial habitat evolved through a mostly hygropetric habitat. The phylogeny also implies that the eastern Nearctic and eastern Palearctic species share a more recent common ancestor than they share with the western Nearctic species, a result further supporting a commonly observed historical biogeographic pattern for these regions. Madeophylax Huryn and Wallace is redefined as a subgenus of Manophylax Wiggins, including the species of the M. altus and M. futabne Species Groups. Keys to adult males, females, larvae, and pupae of the 4 North American species of Manophylax are included.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0887-3593			WOS:000277472300003

The first type consists of a metal cladding, a sandwiched low index dielectric layer, and a high index dielectric core. The second type is the reverse version of the first type. We analyze their modal properties by the use of the mode hybridization concept and calculate the dispersion relations, normalized mode areas, and confinement factors. For the first kind of hybrid waveguide, we can obtain less loss with similar confinement and slightly less overlap between optical modes and the core region. For the second kind of hybrid waveguide, we can obtain strong confinement and enhanced optical fields in a low refractive index region.

Vertical distribution of haematophagous Diptera in temperate forests of the southeastern USA								MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY				24	2			182	188		10.1111/j.1365-2915.2010.00862.x			JUN 2010	2010	The vertical distribution of blood-feeding flies in two temperate forests in the southeastern U.S.A. was determined by placing 15 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention miniature light traps (12 CO(2)-baited, three unbaited controls), without lights, at three heights (1.5 m, 5.0 m, 10.0 m). More than 6550 haematophagous flies, representing 49 species in four families, were collected. Eighteen species were taken almost exclusively (90-100%) at 1.5 m or 10.0 m, and the mean number of flies per trap differed significantly with height for another six species. Five species exhibited shifts in vertical distribution between the two forests, indicating that forest structure could influence the height of host searching. Most (52.5%) mammalophilic flies were collected at 1.5 m, whereas most (56.4%) ornithophilic flies were taken at 10.0 m, suggesting that host associations influence vertical distributions. The significant differences in the composition of haematophagous fly populations among forest strata emphasize the importance of trap placement in vector surveillance and of understanding the ecological relationships of blood-feeding flies.									8	0	0	8	0	8			0269-283X			WOS:000277975700011	20374479	
J	Kim, Gimun; Shin, Bongsik; Grover, Varun								INVESTIGATING Two CONTRADICTORY VIEWS OF FORMATIVE MEASUREMENT IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH								MIS QUARTERLY				34	2	SI		345	365					JUN 2010	2010	The use of formative measurement in the field of Information Systems has increased, arguably due to statistical tools (e.g., PLS) that can test such models. However, in the literature, there exist two contradictory views on the potential deficiency of formative measurement. While opponents who are critical of formative measurement argue that there are native weaknesses of the formative approach in model estimation, proponents who are in favor of using formative measurement counter that opponents research methods in measurement model specification are flawed. The goal of this work is to empirically test these opposing views on whether the alleged estimation instability of formative measurement is due to measurement model misspecification or simply the shortcoming of formative measurement. To assess the integrity of arguments of both parties, we adopt a research design in which four different cases are tested in terms of interpretational confounding and external consistency. We find that regardless of whether there is a specification issue, formative measures can lead to misleading outcomes. Based on the results, we offer guidelines that researchers may adopt in planning and executing data analysis with structural equation modeling. Given that the use of formative measurement is at a critical juncture in the IS field, we believe that the guidelines in this research note are important to promote appropriate use of the approach rather than relegate it to a bandwagon effect.									39	1	0	0	1	40			0276-7783			WOS:000278200600008

Understanding the effects of polymer extrusion filter layering configurations using simulation-based optimization								OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING				11	2			339	354		10.1007/s11081-009-9096-0			JUN 2010	2010	A challenge in polymer processing is the removal of debris, via filtration, from the polymer melt during the extrusion process. We propose measures of filter performance and an optimization strategy to identify parameters that maximize the lifetime of the filter while maintaining product quality. We analyze the benefits of using extrusion filters with more than one layer and evaluate the feasibility of combining competing objectives into a single functional. Our optimization uses a three-dimensional simulation tool for the filtration process as a black-box; thus, gradient information is unavailable and a derivative-free method, the implicit filtering algorithm, is used. We present numerical results that verify that multi-layered filters are more effective than single-layer filters, and that favorable designs have smaller pore diameters in the bottom layer than in the top layer. In addition, the results indicate that our single functional approach is reasonable.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1389-4420	1573-2924		WOS:000277790400007

The paper aims at simulating this self-organization with Monte Carlo dynamics while accounting spatial interactions in lattices of Markov Random Fields that enable also modelling of Plateau-Rayleigh instability of instable mixtures of dispersed immiscible liquids. The Hammersley and Clifford theorem, concerning the general form of energy function, belonging to Markov Random Fields, is introduced for detailed classification of a simple model used for computer simulation. The relevant Auto-model, with Kawasaki dynamics, is chosen to investigate the liquid jet and the instability of the liquid's cylindrical film. The computer-simulated outputs show encouraging agreement with the classic analytical predictions on main features of the Rayleigh instability. The model is also used as a foundation stone for developing a simple analytical approach for the estimation of Rayleigh wavelength of jets and cylindrical films, composed of instable mixtures of immiscible liquids. Qualitatively, the theory agrees with both computer simulation and experiment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-4371			WOS:000276886300002

Reduced Sensitivity in Monilinia fructicola Field Isolates from South Carolina and Georgia to Respiration Inhibitor Fungicides								PLANT DISEASE				94	6			737	743		10.1094/PDIS-94-6-0737			JUN 2010	2010	Quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SdhI) fungicides are respiration inhibitors (RIs) used for preharvest control of brown rot of stone fruit. Both chemical classes are site-specific and, thus, prone to resistance development. Between 2006 and 2008, 157 isolates of Monilinia fructicola collected from multiple peach and nectarine orchards with or without RI spray history in South Carolina and Georgia were characterized based upon conidial germination and mycelial growth inhibition for their sensitivity to QoI fungicides azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin. SdhI fungicide boscalid, and a mixture of pyraclostrobin + boscalid. There was no significant difference (P = 0.05) between EC(50) values for inhibition of conidial germination versus mycelial growth. The mean EC(50) values based upon mycelial growth tests for 25 isolates from an orchard without RI-spray history were 0.15, 0.06, 2.23, and 0.09 mu g/ml for azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, boscalid, and pyraclostrobin + boscalid, respectively. The respective mean EC(50) values for 76 isolates from RI-sprayed orchards in South Carolina were 0.9, 0.1, 10.7, and 0.13 mu g/ml and for 56 isolates from RI-sprayed orchards in Georgia were 1.2, 0.1, 8.91, and 0.17 mu g/ml. Overall, mean EC(50) values of populations from RI-sprayed orchards increased three-, two-, five-, and twofold between 2006 and 2008 for azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, boscalid, and pyraclostrobin + boscalid, respectively. A subset of 10 M. fructicola isolates representing low and high EC(50) values for azoxystrobin, boscalid, and boscalid + pyraclostrobin was selected for a detached fruit assay to determine disease incidence and severity following protective treatments of formulated RI fungicides at label rates. Brown rot incidence was greater than 50% when fruit were inoculated with isolates having EC(50) values of 2, 4, and 0.6 mu g/ml for azoxystrobin. boscalid, and pyraclostrobin + boscalid, respectively. Pyraclostrobin failed to control any of the isolates tested in detached fruit assays. Based on minimum inhibitory concentration and brown rot incidence data, we recommend using 3, 7.5, and 0.75 mu g/ml as discriminatory doses to distinguish between sensitive isolates and those with reduced sensitivity to azoxystrobin, boscalid, and pyraclostrobin + boscalid, respectively. Results from our in vitro and in vivo assays indicate a shift toward reduced sensitivity in M. fructicola from the southeastern United States. No cross-resistance was observed between the QoI and the SdhI fungicides, which implies that rotation or tank mixtures of these two chemical classes can be used as a resistance management strategy.									26	2	0	25	1	28			0191-2917			WOS:000277844300012

Impact of Material Properties and Processing Conditions on Film Formation								POLYMER ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE				50	6			1151	1160		10.1002/pen.21637			JUN 2010	2010	Material properties have a significant impact on the response of polymers to industrial flow processes such as film casting. During film casting, molten polymer is extruded through an (approximately) rectangular die and then cooled rapidly. Subsequent biaxial stretching can be employed to manipulate the film properties. In this work, we investigate the effect of polymer viscosity (molecular weight), draw ratio, and die temperature on polypropylene film formation. We measure the width, two components of the velocity vector, and the temperature profiles throughout the film web. The polymer rheology and the die temperature affect the film geometry and temperature profiles in the air-gap. The magnitude of the machine direction velocity component depends on both the machine and transverse position in the film. The velocity shows a maximum at the centerline and decreases toward the film edge. The measured transverse velocity component, a consequence of the film neck-in, is seen to decrease from the film edges to the centerline. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 50:1151-1160, 2010.

Nisaplin and Guardian CS1-50 were added at 6 and 5 different concentrations to cast gelatin-based films to inhibit Listeria monocytogenes inoculated in liquid media, solid media, and on bologna. Color properties and antimicrobial activity were measured during storage of films at 21 degrees C +/- 2. For the shelf-life study on bologna, color change and antimicrobial effect of 0.5% Nisaplin and 1% Guardian were measured. The intensity of yellowness in films increased as both Nisaplin and Guardian concentrations increased. Film tensile strength and percentage of elongation decreased as incorporation of antimicrobials increased. All 6 Nisaplin films showed a 3-log reduction after 1 h and a 6-log reduction after 6 to 8 h compared with control, in which there was no reduction in Listeria population in 0.1% peptone water. Two Guardian films (0.5 and 1%) showed approximately a 3-log reduction in 24 h. In the solid media, all Nisaplin films (except 0.05%) and all Guardian films inhibited L. monocytogenes after 48 h of incubation. Nisaplin films and all Guardian films still showed antilisterial effects after 16 wk of storage in the solid media. Total color difference compared with control (bologna) decreased from highest to lowest in the following order: 1% Guardian > control (film with no antimicrobial) > 0.5% Nisaplin film > bologna. Both 0.5% Nisaplin film (4 log lower than control) and 1% Guardian film (3 log lower than control) effectively inhibited L. monocytogenes on bologna during storage at 4 degrees C for 56 d.									9	0	0	7	0	9			0032-5791			WOS:000277974700027	20460678

We examine the racially-specific effects of high school course of study on college selectivity. Using NELS 1988-1994, we test how race and track interactively predict the prestige of the first post-secondary institution attended. We find support for a "redemptive equity model" of college prestige for Latinos, who attend more selective colleges than White students, net of background and academic variables. Asian American students also attend more selective institutions than White students. Results for African-American students are more complicated, in that the colleges they attend are not significantly different from those of Whites, on average. When we exclude students who attend historically Black colleges and universities, however, African-American students attend significantly more prestigious universities than Whites, net of other factors. We also find racially-specific effects of high school course of study, with Latinos, Asian Americans, and African-Americans appearing to benefit more from taking more rigorous academic courses than Whites.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0361-0365	1573-188X		WOS:000276902000004

In this paper, we analyze and measure the actuation characteristics of composite piezoelectric diaphragms that are biased by a static pressure that induces diaphragm curvature. To analyze the actuation characteristics of the curved-diaphragm transducer, a mathematical model for thin diaphragms relating the applied static pressure to the actuation characteristics is developed. In this model, the elastic response to applied pressure is caused by contributions of plate and membrane components. A linear relationship between applied voltage and boundary strain fluctuations was assumed, which leads to an analytic expression for the quasi-static diaphragm displacement amplitude in terms of diaphragm properties and biasing pressure. This expression shows that there is an upper limit to the displacement amplitude enhancement under piezoelectric actuation when diaphragms are curved by a biasing pressure. Measurements of displacement amplitude and acoustic pressure as a function of static bias pressure on micromachined piezoelectric diaphragms showed the expected behavior, which is typically displacement amplification, and a null when bending and stretching effects cancel. The model predicts that a decrease in residual stresses will increase performance at all biasing pressure levels. Residual stresses can be beneficial in a way, in that the pressure for peak performance may be varied to suit a design constraint.

We have found that the structures of nanoscale aggregates depend on various experimental parameters including concentration, substrate and solvent. The self-assembling of PF2/6 from 0.05 mg/mL solution in toluene onto SiO(x)/Si substrate results in the formation of interconnected nanoribbons with thickness and width of about 20 and 150 nm, respectively. Varying polymer concentration and type of substrate (SiO(x)/Si or mica) significantly affects the nanoscale structures. The change of solvent to chlorobenzene, a slightly more polar solvent with slower evaporation rate, causes the growth of ribbon width to micron size with slight increase of the thickness. When the solvents with higher evaporation rate (i.e. chloroform and dichloromethane) are used, densely packed nanoribbons are obtained. Its width also grows to micron size. The measurements of UV/vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra detect some discrepancies in pattern, reflecting the variation of local chain organization within thin films prepared by using different solvents.

This study explored solvent effects on the nature of the catalytic activity of the solid acid tungstated zirconia (WZ) for hydrolysis and transesterification of tricaprylin (TCp), two reactions that can occur during biodiesel synthesis, at 130 degrees C and 12.2 atm in a batch reactor using different solvents. It was found that hexane and a mixture of lauric acid (HLa) and hexane resulted in the highest catalytic activities for transesterification and hydrolysis, respectively, probably due to their non-polar and low kinematic viscosity inducing characteristics. Tetrahydrofuran (THF), in contrast, having a higher polarity, tended to reduce the activity for both hydrolysis and transesterification by competing for active sites on the WZ surface and being involved in side reactions with methanol.

SAM-modified microdisc electrode arrays (MDEAs) with functionalized carbon nanotubes								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				55	14	SI		4247	4255		10.1016/j.electacta.2008.12.043			MAY 30 2010	2010	The construction of a novel voltammetric transducer employing mixed acid-chopped, oxidatively modified, single-walled carbon nanotubes (HOOC-SWNT-COOH) covalently coupled to alkane thiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) that were deposited onto gold microdisc electrode arrays (MDEA-Au) (1296 microdiscs, 100 mu m diameter each) has been demonstrated. The chemisorption of cysteamine (CA) and 11-amino-1-undecanethiol (11-AUT) SAMs onto the MDEAs resulted in MDEA-Au vertical bar CA and MDEA-Au vertical bar 11-AUT, which when conjugated with the HOOC-SWNT-COOH produced MDEA-Au vertical bar CA vertical bar SWNT and MDEA-Au vertical bar 11-AUT vertical bar SWNT electrodes. Electrodes were characterized by multiple scan rate cyclic voltammetry in the presence of ferrocene monocarboxylic acid and by AFM and compared. As expected, CA modification of MDEA-Au produced a disordered film that did not alter the effective surface area of the MDEA while 11-AUT modification resulted in passivation and a 50% reduction in effective surface area. The conjugation of the SWNT to the CA-modified and the 11-AUT-modified MDEA-Au surface returned well-resolved voltammograms with highest peak currents (I-pa = 5.54 x 10(-4) A, I-pc =2.34 x 10(-4) A at 100 mV/s). The effective area of MDEA-Au vertical bar CA vertical bar SWNT was increased by 200% while that of MDEA-Au vertical bar 11-AUT vertical bar SWNT was increased by 100%. AFM showed SWNTs to be vertically oriented on the CA-modified surface but to be horizontally arranged and bundled on the 11-AUT surface.

BindN plus for accurate prediction of DNA and RNA-binding residues from protein sequence features								BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY				4						S3	10.1186/1752-0509-4-S1-S3		1	MAY 28 2010	2010	Background: Understanding how biomolecules interact is a major task of systems biology. To model protein-nucleic acid interactions, it is important to identify the DNA or RNA-binding residues in proteins. Protein sequence features, including the biochemical property of amino acids and evolutionary information in terms of position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), have been used for DNA or RNA-binding site prediction. However, PSSM is rather designed for PSI-BLAST searches, and it may not contain all the evolutionary information for modelling DNA or RNA-binding sites in protein sequences.Results: In the present study, several new descriptors of evolutionary information have been developed and evaluated for sequence-based prediction of DNA and RNA-binding residues using support vector machines (SVMs). The new descriptors were shown to improve classifier performance. Interestingly, the best classifiers were obtained by combining the new descriptors and PSSM, suggesting that they captured different aspects of evolutionary information for DNA and RNA-binding site prediction. The SVM classifiers achieved 77.3% sensitivity and 79.3% specificity for prediction of DNA-binding residues, and 71.6% sensitivity and 78.7% specificity for RNA-binding site prediction.Conclusions: Predictions at this level of accuracy may provide useful information for modelling protein-nucleic acid interactions in systems biology studies. We have thus developed a web-based tool called BindN+ (http://bioinfo.ggc.org/bindn+/) to make the SVM classifiers accessible to the research community.									66	2	0	58	0	68			1752-0509			WOS:000278136300003	20522253	
J	Hazari, Zahra; Potvin, Geoff; Tai, Robert H.; Almarode, John								For the love of learning science: Connecting learning orientation and career productivity in physics and chemistry								PHYSICAL REVIEW SPECIAL TOPICS-PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH				6	1					010107	10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.6.010107			MAY 21 2010	2010	An individual's motivational orientation serves as a drive to action and can influence their career success. This study examines how goal orientation toward the pursuit of a graduate degree in physics and chemistry influences later success outcomes of practicing physicists and chemists. Two main categories of goal orientation are examined in this paper: performance orientation or motivation to demonstrate one's ability or performance to others, and learning orientation or motivation through the desire to learn about a topic. The data were obtained as part of Project Crossover, a mixed-methods study which focused on studying the transition from graduate student to scientist in the physical sciences and included a survey of members of two national professional physical science organizations. Using regression analysis on data from 2353 physicists and chemists, results indicate that physicists and chemists who reported a learning orientation as their motivation for going to graduate school were more productive, in terms of total career primary and/or first-author publications and grant funding, than those reporting a performance orientation. Furthermore, given equal salary, learning-oriented individuals produced more primary and/or first-author publications than their nonlearning oriented counterparts.									17	0	0	2	0	17			1554-9178			WOS:000278304400001

Simulations were conducted using the CHARMM program and force field using a host guest peptide with the sequence TGTG-X-GTGT (where G and T are glycine and threonine amino acid residues, respectively, with X representing valine, threonine, aspartic acid, phenylalanine or lysine) over nine different functionalized alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM) surfaces with explicitly represented solvent. Delta G(ads) was calculated using biased-energy replica exchange molecular dynamics to adequately sample the conformational states of the system. The simulation results showed that the CHARMM force-field was able to represent Delta G(ads) within 1 kcal/mol of the experimental values for most systems, while deviations as large as 4 kcal/mol were found for others. In particular, the simulations reveal that CHARMM underestimates the strength of adsorption on die hydrophobic and positively charged amine surfaces. These results clearly show that improvements in force field parameterization are needed in order to accurately represent interactions between amino acid residues and functional groups of a surface and they provide a means for force field evaluation and modification for the eventual development and validation of an interfacial force field for the accurate simulation of protein adsorption behavior.									41	0	0	14	0	41			0743-7463			WOS:000277398600072	20222735

The functionalization was selective toward the nanotubes, allowing a nearly complete removal of residual metal catalysts and carbonaceous impurities. The resulting highly pure SWNTs remained solvent-dispersible, a valuable feature to potential applications that require solvent-based processing. The functionalization agent could be recovered quantitatively and reused. Effects of the purification process on the composition and properties of the nanotube sample were evaluated.									16	2	0	0	0	18			0743-7463			WOS:000281444400023	20047344
