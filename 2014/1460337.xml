    <AbstractNarration>Under this grant, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) will organize and run a series of conferences and workshops in the mathematical and computational sciences during the three-year period between October 2015 and September 2018. These SIAM conferences form an important part of the research, education and technology transfer infrastructure for applied and computational mathematics. The funding of this grant will support travel of students and early career professionals, facilitating the integration of education with research. The funding will also support the travel of invited speakers to the conferences and the dissemination of invited conference presentations and tutorials to the wider community on SIAM's audio/slide service. The first event in the series is the SIAM Conference on Applied Linear Algebra to be held October 26-30, 2015 in Atlanta, GA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SIAM conferences and workshops are highly interdisciplinary and foster the communication of the latest fundamental and applied research and applications to mathematical and computational scientists, physical and social scientists, and engineers from academia, industry and government. SIAM conferences are designed to identify and disseminate knowledge of emerging areas of research. Conferences to be held in the first year of the award include the following: SIAM Conference on Applied Linear Algebra, SIAM Conference on Geometric and Physical Modeling, Analysis of Partial Differential Equations, SIAM International Conference on Data Mining, SIAM Conference on Imaging Science, SIAM Conference on Mathematical Aspects of Materials Science, SIAM Conference on Discrete Mathematics, SIAM Conference on the Life Sciences, and SIAM Conference on Nonlinear Waves and Coherent Structures.</AbstractNarration>
