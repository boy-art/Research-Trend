    <AbstractNarration>1450791&lt;br/&gt;Bowles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition of superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM). The SRM will support research and research training in mineral and rock magnetism and paleomagnetism. Fundamental studies in rock magnetism address the physical mechanisms responsible for the acquisition of magnetism by natural mineral phases and the processes through which that magnetism is either recorded with high fidelity or altered by environmental factors. Mineral magnetic investigations have implications for the development of improved materials for use in many industrial applications. Paleomagnetism studies address the behavior of the Earth?s magnetic field through geologic time and have application to understanding the former positions of continents on Earth, the dynamical behavior and evolution of the geomagnetic field and for interpreting past environmental conditions to better constrain the full spectrum of Earth?s past range of climate conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental studies of how magnetic phases acquire magnetization and studies of the historical dynamics of the Earth?s magnetic field based on paleointensity observations as recorded in magnetic phases in rocks and natural volcanic glasses will be supported. The SRM will allow studies of weakly magnetized materials and very small synthesized phases given to the high sensitivity of direct current superconducting quantum interference device (DC-SQUID) on the requested SRM. Such investigations cannot be accomplished with an extant but much less sensitive spinner magnetometer in the investigator?s laboratory. The instrument will be the first of its kind in the state of Wisconsin and will support regional and international collaborations. The investigator will develop instrument control software that will allow for all SRM measurements to be archived and output in a format compatible with a community mineral, rock and paleomagnetism database (MagIC). The SRM will support student research training with a focus on attracting underreprestented students to the geosciences. This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and may advance the national prosperity and welfare through promoting student training for careers in the physical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
