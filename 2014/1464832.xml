    <AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Alan Heyduk of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine to develop new molecular catalysts for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. The utilization of intermittent alternative energy sources such as wind and solar requires that efficient conversion strategies be developed to generate chemical fuels. Water-splitting to afford hydrogen and oxygen is an attractive energy-storing reaction for this goal, and for widespread applicability, these catalysts must be made from inexpensive and earth-abundant elements. This project is also providing avenues for the training of students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels and includes strong representation from groups that are historically underrepresented in the sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Heyduk is developing new tridentate, redox active ligands that can be shuttled among three oxidation states while bound to a metal, as a way to introduce multi-electron redox functionality to the metal complex. The PI is exploring the use of these complexes in the catalysis of important multi-electron reactions, such as water oxidation and proton reduction. The ultimate goal of the project is to generate molecular electrocatalysts for both halves of the water-splitting reaction and based upon earth abundant first row transition metals. The development of new molecular catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of protons to hydrogen and the electrochemical oxidation of water to oxygen provide insights into the mechanistic and kinetic barriers to efficient water splitting. For widespread applicability, these catalysts must be made from inexpensive and earth-abundant elements, where the factors governing multi-electron reactivity are yet to be elucidated. Success in this endeavor will impact alternative energy strategies by providing new avenues for the conversion of transient energy sources into storable, portable, chemical fuels.</AbstractNarration>
