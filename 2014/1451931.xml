    <AbstractNarration>Organisms whose body temperature is set by the environment (such as fish, insects, and reptiles) are particularly sensitive to environmental change (which includes temperature, rainfall, food, and predators). The principal researcher of this project has spent more than thirty years working on such organisms (especially salmon, krill, and wasps and economically important fruit flies, such as the Mediterranean fruit fly), always motivated by an important applied problem but at the same time seeking fundamental understanding of species population dynamics. In doing this work, the researcher has developed novel computer modeling methods, ways of connecting models and field and laboratory studies, and has both solved environmental problems as well as generated new understanding and research directions. This project will provide the opportunity for a synthesis of the ideas developed over the researcher's career. The result of the project will be a framework that can be used by other scientists, resource managers, and stakeholders for a better understanding species responses to climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During his long career, the principal researcher of this project has developed modeling approaches that link a) behavioral ecology and population biology, b) proximate and ultimate factors that shape behavior and life history of organisms, c) variation in individual behavior to population dynamics, d) evolution and ecology, and e) simultaneously address basic and applied questions. This work has made state dependent life history theory, as implemented by stochastic dynamic programming, one of the most powerful tools for understanding the effects of environmental change on ectotherms and for synthesizing the science needed for understanding and predicting the responses of ectotherms to environmental change. The project will support the development of a major synthetic publication that will situate this theory with other approaches to understanding ectotherms in changing environments, using case studies to simultaneously highlight species in specific locations and to develop general principles. Scientists often realize too late in their careers that they should have studied more quantitative methods and learned how to solve problems in biology using mathematical methods. The result of this project will be a source for people to learn how to hypothesize at the mechanisms behind observed patterns, and how to translate them into a living, breathing mathematical model that makes intuitive sense and yet reveals processes or trends that may not be intuitive.</AbstractNarration>
