    <AbstractNarration>Approximately 20 leading scientists will attend this workshop to discuss the "state of the field" with respect to designing novel proteins and enzymes. These scientists represent a broad range of expertise: Some specialize in computational design of novel proteins, while others focus on evolutionary and combinatorial methods for selection and optimization. The purpose of the workshop will be threefold: (i) To describe how contributions from different disciplines have enabled enormous recent advances in our ability to devise novel proteins that fold and function; (ii) To discuss the potential for future developments in this field, and describe how cross-fertilization between disciplines can enhance this progress; and (iii) To explicitly discuss challenges and/or roadblocks that might impede this progress, and to propose approaches that will enable researchers to overcome these challenges in the coming decade. The workshop will focus on both basic science and real-world applications of protein design, engineering, and selection.</AbstractNarration>
