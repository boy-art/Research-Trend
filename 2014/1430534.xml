    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a cost-effective replacement to x-ray-based imaging devices currently used in dentistry. Several peer-reviewed scientific studies have suggested a link between pediatric exposure to x-rays and subsequent development of head tumors. The recent introduction of CT-based dental imaging systems has actually increased x-ray exposure, going against the long-established public health policy of reducing exposure to levels as low as reasonably acceptable (ALARA). This project will provide a cost-effective alternative to dental x-rays (and hence reduce pediatric radiation exposure). The device will also improve the depiction of root disease, which is currently poorly described with x-ray-based systems. The ability to describe both hard and soft tissues with the instrument is valuable to oral surgeons, who must consider the cosmetic results of reconstructive surgery as well as the functional aspects. Commercial impact is demonstrated by the fact that a chain of 2,500 dental clinics, intrigued by the ability of the system to guide oral surgery, has already offered to invest in the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project involves the development of several novel and important research activities that address critical requirements of dental imaging: speed, spatial resolution, avoidance of imaging artifacts due to oral hardware, safety, spatial footprint, cost, and energy budget. The first three of these requirements are addressed through the use of MRI gradient pulses that are hundreds of times faster and stronger than are conventionally used. Safety, energy and spatial footprint, and cost are addressed with novel coil manufacturing techniques that reduce fabrication time from months to days. Energy costs are addressed with novel regenerative schemes similar to those used in hybrid cars. By the end of the project, a working MRI dental system will have been constructed, with demonstrations of its effectiveness (on animal specimens). These steps will ready the product for subsequent human studies that will be required for approval by the FDA. Follow-on applications of the technology to non-dental uses (e.g., trauma, cancer detection) are anticipated.</AbstractNarration>
