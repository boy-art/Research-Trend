    <AbstractNarration>The Linn-Benton Community College's (LBCC's) "Promoting Retention and Completion with STEM Research and Design Cohorts" Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project will annually provide approximately 21 scholarships to academically talented LBCC STEM majors with financial need. Because this project builds upon and expands prior successful S-STEM efforts (Tech Scholars Program, TSP-I and TSP-II), participants will be referred to as TSP-III Scholars. Chemistry, physics, geology, engineering, math, computer science, and biology will be the target majors for the scholarships. Students will engage in research and/or design project experiences as part of one of several possible Research and Design Cohorts (RDCs). This will be accomplished through a one-credit course called "Destination Graduation," which is an institutional requirement; a STEM-centered version of this course will be available to S-STEM scholars. Further, students will have the opportunity to engage in additional optional RDC activities with faculty members after completion of this course. Scholars will be recruited primarily through targeted outreach to four groups: (1) Oregon Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) program, (2) Linn and Benton Counties' 5th Year High School Students, (3) College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP), and (4) For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST) Robotics. Targeting these groups for recruitment is expected to yield a pool of applicants who not only have the academic talent or potential to succeed in STEM disciplines, but also financial need, as many students engaged in some of the programs are low-income, first generation college students. Additionally, the MATE ROV teams in Oregon are roughly 50% female, thus lending to the possibility of broadening participation of women in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expected short-term outcomes of the project are: (1) to provide significant financial relief for the students; (2) to foster an environment where students feel supported by the program and the college to stay in school, have a sense of community at the college, achieve academic success, and transition successfully to a four year program; (3) to engage faculty in a system that assesses outcomes and makes changes when appropriate to improve student learning and retention. The Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) will be used to determine whether or not the students who receive the scholarships indeed face reduced financial strain compared to non S-STEM students, including non-STEM majors. This survey will be issued several times throughout each year allowing for a comprehensive measure of how the scholarships impact financial stability and ability to concentrate on learning. Intermediate expected outcomes are that TSP-III scholars will: (1) be retained and perform well academically compared to their non S-STEM counterparts; and (2) transfer successfully to a four-year institution and feel a continued sense of peer group support at those institutions. Data reflecting student retention and success will be provided by LBCC's Office of Institutional Research to track student performance each quarter allowing faculty, advisors, and project staff to intervene early if problems are identified. The National Student Clearinghouse will be used to track the number and percent of TSP-III Scholars who transfer successfully. In collaboration with partners such as California State University at Fullerton and Oregon State University, a follow-up survey will be administered to obtain feedback on the scholars' experience, progress, and preparedness for the four-year program as well as the extent of peer support received.</AbstractNarration>
