    <AbstractNarration>The DIMACS Project on Catalyzing and Integrating Research, Collaboration, and Learning in Computing, Mathematics, and their Applications provides a resource for a large community of researchers and educators in computer science and related mathematical and statistical areas as well as their collaborators in fields such as biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, public health, business, and the social sciences. The project enhances and encourages programs that emphasize fundamental methods and theory to advance computer science and related mathematics while also encouraging their application in areas with the potential to impact the infrastructure and resources society depends on, including healthcare, environmental sustainability, homeland security, information security, energy, and business. The project also reflects the importance of education at DIMACS and works to build and support communities that facilitate entry into and promote retention and success in computing disciplines. This award partially supports the DIMACS Center infrastructure required to achieve project goals. The programs enabled by the infrastructure this project supports will directly reach an estimate of roughly 2000 people each year, and through them, many others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research programs enabled by the project are organized around special focus programs consisting of workshops, research workshop groups, tutorials, and a visitor program, on topics including Cybersecurity; Information Sharing and Dynamic Data Analysis; Algorithms and Energy; Sustainability; Theoretical Foundations and Scalability of Machine Learning; Health and Medical Informatics; Cryptography; and Analytics of Preference, Opinion, Recommendation, and Comparison. Educational programs integrate research and education across levels from precollege through postdoctoral via activities including an extensive Research Experiences for Undergraduates program; a Reconnect program run at satellite locations around the country for 2-year and 4-year college faculty highlighting recent research topics relevant to the classroom; a year-round program of workshops for middle and high school teachers; and development of classroom materials in areas including bio-mathematics, computational thinking, and planning for sustainability. Connections with researchers in education enhance understanding of the cognitive mechanisms at play when students master computational thinking skills, allowing creation of research-informed materials that facilitate teaching and enhance learning. Several DIMACS programs use multi-layer mentoring models for providing mentoring to students while instilling in them the capacity to mentor, both enhancing their own skills and serving to build excitement for computing and computing-related careers in the next generation.</AbstractNarration>
