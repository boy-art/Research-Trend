    <AbstractNarration>Verbal information is conveyed differently in the world languages. In English, this information is mostly expressed by a simple verb, while in some other languages it is conveyed by a complex structure consisting of two or more components linguists call complex predicates. For example, gerye kardan 'cry doing' (Farsi) translates as the single verb 'to cry' in English. This project focuses on a descriptive and theoretical analysis of complex predicates in seventeen Iranian languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nature of complex predicates has been the subject of many linguistic studies in the last 5-6 decades. One major question is whether they are word-like, or rather phrase-like with each component revealing independent properties. Furthermore, the contribution of each part to the meaning of the whole have long been a central issue in linguistic theory. Crucially, complex predicates reveal distinct behavior with respect to certain constructions compared to those observed in well-studied languages such as English. These constructions include passives (The apple was eaten), resultatives (John wiped the table clean), and causatives (John made Mary leave). The nature of these differences, and the reasons for their existence, are not well understood. New data and the microparametric comparison of the Iranian languages will break new ground in our understanding of the underpinnings of complex predicate formation and their behavior in human language. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data collection will be conducted via linguistic elicitation with native speaker consultants as well as Complex Predicate Questionnaires to be filled out by native speaker consultants trained in linguistics. One of the goals of this project is to transcribe, catalogue and enter the data into a database. All the textual material that forms the basis for the descriptive analysis and pedagogical material will be stored in an accessible format available to public for further study, in addition to a web-based encyclopedia for the target languages. This study promises many benefits. It trains several students as experts in Iranian languages, provides understanding of languages and cultures Americans are interested in, but do not know much about, and fosters research relations between linguists in three continents, which will enrich collaborative activities.</AbstractNarration>
