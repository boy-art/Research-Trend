    <AbstractNarration>Because plants are rooted in the ground, they must have ways for their offspring to move away from home, to colonize new areas. Seeds are usually produced in one of two types of vessels to facilitate this process. A dry pod splits open at maturity to release the seeds, so they can be carried on the wind or, if they have hooks, they can stick to an animal. In contrast, a fleshy fruit such as an apple or cucumber will be eaten by an animal, which will then disperse the seeds. Fleshy fruits provide an important source of nutrition to all animals, including humans; a large part of the human diet and economy is based on fruits such as tomatoes, peppers, melons, squash, or avocados. Many different groups of flowering plants underwent an evolutionary shift from producing a dry pod to a fleshy fruit, with important ecological and economic consequences. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the genetic mechanisms that determine if a plant will produce a dry pod or an edible, fleshy fruit. The work focuses on the nightshade family, which includes pod-producing species such as desert tobacco and petunia, as well as fleshy-fruit-producing species such as tomato, eggplant, and pepper. These experiments look at the role of a group of genes that appears to have undergone a change in function associated with the origin of fleshy fruit. The results may identify specific genes or changes in genes that allow a species to make an edible, nutritious fruit, which could contribute to crop improvement or development. This project also will form the basis of two botanical garden exhibits on fruit structure and diversity in the nightshade family, and will provide training for high school students and undergraduates from under-represented minorities, as well as for a graduate student and a post-doctoral researcher. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MADS-box transcription factor FRUITFULL (FUL) plays a key role in the development of the Arabidopsis fruit by determining the patterns of cell differentiation that are required for the fruit to elongate and split open normally to release the seeds. FUL orthologs have also been shown to be required for proper ripening in some fleshy fruits, showing a conserved function in fruit development, but with a substantially different outcome. Fruits in the nightshade family (Solanaceae) are ancestrally dry and dehiscent, but there was a shift to fleshy fruit with the origin of the Solanoideae clade. The FUL gene clade has undergone duplications leading to four copies in some species, and the first part of this project will generate a gene tree using a combination of transcriptome and targeted PCR approaches to identify when duplications occurred. The data will also be used to determine whether different paralogous clades have undergone different modes of evolution (neutral, purifying, etc), which will be correlated with the functional data collected in the second part. The second part uses CRISPR technology to compare the function of the four FUL paralogs in desert tobacco and tomato to determine how the function of each paralog changed during Solanaceae evolution. Double and quadruple mutants will also be evaluated and transcriptomes generated to determine the effect of downregulation on downstream targets in both dry and fleshy fruit development. The focus will be on early stages of development, prior to ripening and dehiscence, when defining characteristics such as pericarp thickness and cell type identity are specified. The data will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms required to produce a fleshy fruit, and will elucidate the processes underlying a key evolutionary phenomenon, the shift from dry to fleshy fruit production. All data will be publicly available upon publication through GenBank, Sol Genomics Network, and the Dryad repository. Mutant lines and seed will be available upon request from the investigators.</AbstractNarration>
