    <AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Delaware offers research experiences in multidisciplinary materials research with energy and sustainability applications to diverse and talented cohorts of students, including those from minority serving institutions and primarily undergraduate institutions in the region. The students' research projects have meaningful and positive impacts on society by developing sustainable energy technologies, with topics spanning from energy generated from biomass to the development of next-generation fuel cell membranes. The REU Site aims to enhance U.S. competitiveness through the development of a diverse and engaged workforce by enabling students to: acquire a practical and engaging research experience, develop their interest in pursuing a graduate degree education, understand the graduate school experience and admissions process, and develop long-term professional and social connections with fellow participants, graduate students, and faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site offers opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in comprehensive research experiences on cutting-edge topics, using state-of-the-art methods, which reinforce and strengthen their classroom knowledge and encourage pursuit of graduate education. During the 10-week experience, students perform materials engineering and science research projects involving photovoltaic devices, catalytic materials, or nanomaterials and nanocomposites. The students collaborate with a faculty mentor in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering or Materials Science and Engineering along with a trained graduate student and post-doc mentors. They also participate in a professional development program that includes training in communications and research methods skills, graduate school information sessions, and workshops on research ethics and ethics of technologies. The students are provided with opportunities to present their research results in a research symposium held at the end of the summer and participate in field trips to nearby research and development facilities (of chemical, materials, and energy companies) to augment laboratory research activities with examples of the translation of science and engineering advances to commercial practice. The program is partnering with 11 colleges, universities and programs as part of comprehensive recruitment plan to ensure a diverse and talented applicant pool for the REU Site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
