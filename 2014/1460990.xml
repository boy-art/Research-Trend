    <AbstractNarration>University of Michigan chemistry professors Brian Coppola and Melanie Sanford co-direct the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Interdisciplinary Chemistry, funded by the Chemistry Division of NSF. This is a continuation of a long established program that began in 1989. In this renewal, 15 students from around the United States, recruited primarily from settings where individuals do not have the opportunity to carry out graduate-level research, spend 10 weeks engaged as full-fledged participants in the department's research groups. There is a recruiting emphasis on women and students from underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;Additional activities (lectures, workshops, trips, and social events), offered jointly with other programs on- and off-campus, provide a broad integration into scientific and professional communities. A regional poster session is the culminating activity each summer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students participate in a diverse collection of modern research problems centered in the interdisciplinary chemical programs in the University of Michigan chemistry department, including chemical biology, organometallics, energy, sustainability, surface science, sensors, optics and imaging, RNA biochemistry, and ultrafast dynamics. The REU students have access to all of the research groups in the chemistry department, including interdisciplinary groups. REU students produce publishable results. The experience also gives participants confidence to remain in science, pursue graduate education, and ultimately to join the technically-trained workforce in academia, industry, or government laboratories.</AbstractNarration>
