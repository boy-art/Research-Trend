    <AbstractNarration>This proposal would provide funding for continued operation of the Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility (AMGRF) at Florida State University. This facility is the NSF repository of sediment cores from the ocean floor surrounding Antarctica, and makes sediment cores available to the entire scientific community, providing the equipment and knowledge necessary for scientists to collect samples for specialized measurements. The sediments provide a record of past climate, ocean circulation, and ice sheet history, and were recovered at great cost using piston cores deployed from research vessels and rotary coring from drilling platforms. The funding supports a curator, an assistant curator, and a student work force from FSU. This staff supports visiting scientists, manages the collections and the equipment used for core characterization and sampling, and maintain data bases. The AMGRF houses a unique collection of sediment cores from the Southern Oceans and has served in this role for the past 50 years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility (AMGRF) at Florida State University, the NSF repository of Southern Ocean piston- and drill-cores, has been conducting marine geological research and providing numerous services to the Antarctic and Earth Science Community in its present building for the past 50 years. This proposal requests operating funds to (a) continue provide these services, (b) manage archives and databases, (c) complete necessary upgrades of the AMGRF Cold-Room, and (d) continue our education and outreach programs for students and the general public. The AMGRF archives and curates more than 23,000 m of cored sediment (over 7,000 cores) collected by United States Antarctic Program (USAP) vessels. The Facility also archives and curates some 5,500 m of rotary-cored material from international programs such as ANDRILL. The standard core processing services include core splitting, Multi-Sensor Track analyses, core photography, whole-core x-rays, etc., core description publications (macroscopic and microscopic), and core sampling. Facility personnel also provide curatorial support services to field-based projects upon request. Analytical equipment at the AMGRF serves the research needs of Facility personnel (for the generation of detailed core descriptions), NSF Principal Investigators involved with the United States Antarctic Program (USAP), and qualified users from the scientific community in the U.S. and beyond. This equipment provides users of the Facility with the necessary tools to rapidly and objectively analyze the piston cores and drill cores sent to the Facility each year. The AMGRF maintains a core and sample database with the latest map-sample search capabilities that can be accessed through the continuously upgraded Facility website. This searchable database contains basic information about all the cores stored at the facility, as well as information on samples taken from 1964 to the present. In addition to the sediment core archives the AMGRF also keeps archives of ship and deck-logs, a collection of ca. 862,000 microscope slides, and a library of AMGRF related publications. Facility personnel routinely provide tours and lectures for students and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
