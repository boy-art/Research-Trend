    <AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Maine focuses on sensor science and engineering research which is of high interest to the consumer, national defense, and homeland security, and reflects one of the top research strengths at UMaine. Maine's sensor science and engineering research ranges from basic theoretical studies to the design, fabrication, and testing of prototype sensors for chemical and biological agents related to terrorism; peroxide based explosives; neurotoxins; E-coli; pesticides; nitric oxide (related to respiratory distress in humans); oil viscosity for the automotive industry; airborne elements such as chlorine, and mercury; fish pathogens; and ammonia/nitric oxide (for fossil fuel burning systems). Other areas of research relate to the processing and analysis of data obtained from sensors, wireless networks and their applications to biological and envinronmental research. The program will provide state-of-the art, interdisciplinary research and problem solving opportunities for REU participants. Undergraduates will utilize their new knowledge to solve real-life research problems that impact society. Society will benefit as undergraduates, as a result of their research experiences, choose to continue in graduate school to excel in technologically and scientifically challenging careers that advance such areas as homeland security, food safety, transportation, communications, and medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU program will offer a 10-week intensive summer research experience, for a total of 30 students, over a three year period. The program will include: 1) individual research projects with faculty research mentors utilizing specialized sensor science and engineering research facilities, 2) ethics training, 3) student meetings, 4) seminars, 5) field trips, 6) student presentations, and 7) career guidance, networking opportunities, and mentorship. Recruitment will focus specifically on women and minorities and provide research experiences for students at non-PhD granting institutions. This emphasis on recruiting women and minorities will also further impact the NSF Track III Stormwater Management Research Team (SMART), which emphasizes the involvement of women and minority high school students and teachers. The REU participants will share their research experiences with middle and high school students and teachers participating in the SMART institute and provide a further role model for these high school students.</AbstractNarration>
