    <AbstractNarration>The University of North Georgia (UNG), through the project entitled "Strengthening Pathways to the Baccalaureate for STEM Scholars from a Predominantly 2-Year Campus" will strive to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce by recruiting, mentoring, and supporting academically talented but financially needy students through degree completion and partnering with employers to facilitate placement in the STEM workforce. The project will focus on students who enroll at UNG's Gainesville Campus, which has a mission of that of a traditional 2-year institution, and who transfer to baccalaureate STEM programs at UNG's Dahlonega Campus, and also seek to improve student retention and graduation rates on both campuses. The project will support full time students in programs leading to associate or baccalaureate degrees in biological sciences (except medicine or other clinical fields), physical sciences (including physics, chemistry and materials science), mathematical sciences, and technology areas associated with the aforementioned disciplines. Among the intended broader impacts are providing students with skills to improve academic and workforce competitiveness, increasing faculty involvement in mentoring students, fostering permanent changes in organizational practices to provide an environment that encourages and supports diversity, and increasing the economic diversity of the STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will achieve four key objectives: (1) improve educational opportunities for financially needy students by awarding 24 competitive scholarships annually, (2) increase retention of students to degree achievement by creating supportive environments through enhancements in organizational culture and practices; (3) improve student support programs by providing faculty mentoring, peer mentoring, academic workshops, tutoring, an early alert system, counseling, disciplinary activities, undergraduate research experiences, and participation in professional meetings; and (4) increase the number of well-educated, skilled employees in the STEM workforce by implementing the project with industry partners, who will provide guest lecturers, site visits, special activities and internship and placement opportunities in STEM occupations. The initiative will advance knowledge of effective practices that prepare students to pursue STEM careers from traditional 2-year institutions, the nation's fastest growing educational level, by innovatively integrating student support and placement.</AbstractNarration>
