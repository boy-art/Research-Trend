    <AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at the Community College of Allegheny County, Allegheny Campus, will provide scholarships, academic support, and wraparound services to talented associate's degree students majoring in Biotechnology, Bioremediation, and Math &amp; Science (BioMaS) who demonstrate financial need. The project will address the need for biotechnology workers, as well as science and mathematics teachers, in the ten-county Pittsburgh region by training scholarship recipients for employment in these high-growth sectors, and providing the support scholars need to excel and become highly-qualified graduates in their fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BioMaS project goals will include (1) providing scholarships and critical wraparound services, including an onsite clinical social worker to assist students with barriers, internship opportunities, and the job search; learning community experiences; and tutoring to improve retention, persistence, graduation and employment rates; (2) strengthening pathways to employment; (3) connecting degree programs to regional industry by linking potential employers and college training to solidify and build sustainability through an employment pipeline; and (4) providing information on STEM training and jobs for high-school and college students, including veterans and underrepresented minorities. The BioMaS project will create pathways to biotechnology and bioremediation employment opportunities, or to further education for graduates, by leveraging well-established business and higher education partnerships. In addition, a partnership with Indiana University of Pennsylvania will provide a pathway for BioMaS Math &amp; Sciences graduates to obtain bachelor's degrees in middle-level education in math and science. Project goals will be evaluated via both qualitative and quantitative analyses of data such as scholar demographics, enrollment and completion patterns, background preparation, and course and program performance; scholar participation rates and feedback regarding optional program elements; and rates of employment. The project is ultimately expected to serve as a model for community colleges, particularly in terms of understanding of how to develop wraparound services for students that will support them as they prepare to contribute to a highly-skilled STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>
